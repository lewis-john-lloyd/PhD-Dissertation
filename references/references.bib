  abstract = {Interfacial closure models in most two-fluid system codes for reactor
	safety are usually tied to the flow regime map through the mean void
	fraction in a computational cell. When a void fraction discontinuity
	exists in a computational volume, neither heat nor momentum exchange
	at the phase interface for this particular cell can be properly represented
	in finite-difference equations governing the fluid flow. Moreover,
	finite-difference methods with a fixed, Eulerian grid will inaccurately
	predict the cell-to-cell convection of mass, momentum and energy
	when the mean cell macroscopic variables are convected from the cell
	containing the void fraction front. The adequate modeling of two-phase
	mixture levels requires the knowledge of front position and void
	fractions above and below the front. In order to obtain such information,
	an efficient and simple tracking method was implemented in the TRAC-BWR
	code (released April 1984). We have tested this method with a simple
	problem involving a moving two-phase air/water mixture level. The
	results revealed inconsistencies in the behavior of velocities, pressures
	and interfacial friction, and some bounded numerical oscillations.
	Following our numerical experiment, we developed a systematic approach
	to improve the two-phase level tracking method. We present this approach
	and the results of implementation in the TRAC-BWR code.},

	is the potential release of highly radiotoxic fission product (FP)
	isotopes of ruthenium. The highest risk for a large quantity of these
	isotopes to reach the containment arises from air ingress following
	vessel melt-through. One work package (WP) of the source term topic
	of the EU 6th Framework Network of Excellence project SARNET is producing
	and synthesizing information on ruthenium release and transport with
	the aim of validating or improving the corresponding modelling in
	the European ASTEC severe accident analysis code. The WP includes
	reactor scenario studies that can be used to define conditions for
	new experiments. The experimental database currently being reviewed
	includes the following programmes: - AECL experiments conducted on
	fission product release in air; results are relevant to CANDU loss
	of end-fitting accidents; - VERCORS tests on FP release and transport
	conducted by CEA in collaboration with IRSN and EDF; additional tests
	may potentially be conducted in more oxidizing conditions in the
	VERDON facility; - RUSET tests by AEKI investigating ruthenium transport
	with and without other FP simulants; - Experiments by VTT on ruthenium
	transport and speciation in highly oxidizing conditions. In addition
	to the above, at IRSN and at ENEA modelling of fission product release
	and of fuel oxidation is being pursued, the latter being an essential
	boundary condition influencing ruthenium release. Reactor scenario
	studies have been carried out at INR, EDF and IRSN: calculations
	of air ingress scenarios with respectively ICARE/CATHARE V2; SATURNE-MAAP;
	and ASTEC codes provided first insights of thermal-hydraulic conditions
	that the fuel may experience after lower head vessel failure. This
	paper summarizes the status of this work and plans for the future.},

  abstract = {Postulated air ingress accidents, while of very low probability in
	a modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR), are of considerable
	interest to the plant designer, operator, and regulator because of
	the possibility that the core could sustain significant damage under
	some circumstances. Sensitivity analyses are described that cover
	a wide spectrum of conditions affecting outcomes of the postulated
	accident sequences, for both prismatic and pebble-bed core designs.
	The major factors affecting potential core damage are the size and
	location of primary system leaks, flow path resistances, the core
	temperature distribution, and the long-term availability of oxygen
	in the incoming gas from a confinement building. Typically, all the
	incoming oxygen entering the core area is consumed within the reactor
	vessel, so it is more a matter of where, not whether, oxidation occurs.
	An air ingress model with example scenarios and means for mitigating
	damage are described. Representative designs of modular HTGRs included

  abstract = {The French thermal-hydraulic code CATHARE is being developed in Grenoble
	by EDF, FRAMATOME and CEA. The best-estimate objectives of CATHARE
	require a very rigorous methodology for development and assessment.
	In particular, the validation process is performed in two steps:
	qualification of the models against separate effect tests and verification
	of the code on integral loop tests. The validation reports and the
	resulting evaluation document and user guidelines manual are delivered
	to the users. This paper illustrates the methodology for the case
	of CATHARE 1 version 1.3.
	
	The qualification process was conducted with reference to a matrix
	of 300 tests selected from experiments on critical flow, flow pattern
	determination, blowdown of heated or adiabatic test sections in various
	geometries, reflooding, boil-off, steam generator and pump behaviour,
	fuel thermomechanics. The results show the adequacy and the consistency
	of the models but indicate some items to be further studied: droplet
	diameter correlation, incipience of boiling model, critical flow
	in diaphragms, top-down rewet or reflood, interphase friction in
	rod bundle geometry.
	
	The verification process was performed on 21 tests coming from LOBI,
	LOFT, LSTF, PKL facilities. The natural circulation post-test calculations
	show good results for single phase or two-phase mass flowrate evaluation
	and a satisfactory prediction of the reflux condensor phase. The
	various phases of the small break or large break transients are generally
	well described by CATHARE. However, some quantitative discrepancies
	underline limited deficiencies in the domain of condensation at safety
	injection, CCFL at steam generator inlet or core upper tie plate,
	multidimensional effects in annular downcomer and in core region,
	modelling of steam generator secondary side.
	
	The consideration of these items led to the introduction of significant
	improvements and new capabilities in the CATHARE 2 version which
	consequently has to be validated following the same two-step process
	and with an extended test matrix.
	
	The efficiency of such a rigorous methodology has induced the French
	nuclear industry (EDF, FRAMATOME) to use CATHARE for safety research
	and development studies.},

	metal tests; the main result being that the level of dispersal was

	(HTRs) make events leading to severe core damage highly unlikely
	and constitute the main differentiating aspects compared to LWRs.
	Furthermore, while a known and stable regulatory environment has
	long been established for Light Water Reactors (LWRs), different
	ways of thinking may help to develop a more appropriate licensing
	process for HTR-based power plants. The HTR-L project funded by the
	European Commission in the 5th Framework Programme was dedicated
	to the definition of a common and coherent European safety approach
	and the identification of the main licensing issues for the licensing
	framework of the modular HTRs. Several topics were developed during
	the course of this project. Due to the characteristics of the HTR
	design, it has been necessary to define specific defence-in-depth
	requirements which have then been evaluated for implementation in
	the safety approach. Safety-related functions appropriate for the
	HTR design have also had to be identified and listed. On one hand,
	the different possible solicitations of the fuel particles constituted
	the starting point for the identification of the accidental conditions
	(by means of the Master Logic Diagrams methodology); these accidental
	conditions were classified and the most appropriate methods to consider
	ultra low probability severe accidents were examined. On the other
	hand, the elements constituting the source term and, in particular,
	the requirements for the confinement of radioactive products and
	the conditions required to prevent the need for a #conventional#
	containment structure have been discussed. In the definition of the
	safety approach, attention has been paid to the need to maintain
	the potentially interesting economic perspectives of HTR reactors.
	Key issues to be addressed in the licensing process of the HTRs have
	also been identified. An innovative systems, structures and components
	classification method has been developed and rules that will govern
	equipment qualification proposed.},

	an emergency situation due to the blocking of few Helium channels
	in the core. In this situation, some Helium channels for coolant
	passage are blocked and the related issue is the temperature distribution
	within the assemblies, as well as the locations of the local extrema
	in graphite and fuel media, that must not exceed 1600 °C. Two configurations
	are investigated, depending on the situation of the blocked fuel
	assembly in the core. The blocked assembly is surrounded by six unblocked
	fuel assemblies in the first situation and by five unblocked fuel
	assemblies and one reflector assembly in the second situation. This
	numerical study is performed using the thermal-hydraulic CFD code
	Trio_U. Trio_U is developed at CEA Grenoble and especially designed
	to simulate unsteady turbulent flows developing in complex geometries.
	For the present work, an accurate description of 3D conduction problem
	(graphite and fuel), coupled with a simplified 1D thermal-hydraulic
	modelling for Helium is used. The reported simulations suggest that
	the main temperature increase is limited to the blocked fuel assembly
	and do not spread over surrounded assemblies. This seems to be due
	to the Helium flow rate in the gaps between blocks. Moreover, the
	present results show that the maximum temperature criterion is not
	respected for the blocking conditions at nominal power for the blocked
	assembly.},

	The dependence of Sherwood number and the rate of burning on particle

  abstract = {Particles of char derived from a variety of fuels (e.g., biomass,
	sewage sludge, coal, or graphite), with diameters in excess of ,
	burn in fluidized bed combustors containing smaller particles of,
	e.g., sand, such that the rate is controlled by the diffusion both
	of O2 to the burning solid and of the products CO and CO2 away from
	it into the particulate phase. It is therefore important to characterize
	these mass transfer processes accurately. Measurements of the burning
	rate of char particles made from sewage sludge suggest that the Sherwood
	number, Sh, increases linearly with the diameter of the fuel particle,
	dchar (for ). This linear dependence of Sh on dchar is expected from
	the basic equation Sh=2[epsilon]mf(1+dchar/2[delta]diff)/[tau], provided
	the thickness of the boundary layer for mass transfer, [delta]diff,
	is constant in the region of interest (). Such a dependence is not
	seen in the empirical equations currently used and based on the Frössling
	expression. It is found here that for chars made from sewage sludge
	(for ), the thickness of the boundary layer for mass transfer in
	a fluidized bed, [delta]diff, is less than that predicted by empirical
	correlations based on the Frössling expression. In fact, [delta]diff
	is not more than the diameter of the fluidized sand particles. Finally,
	the experiments in this study indicate that models based on surface
	renewal theory should be rejected for a fluidized bed, because they
	give unrealistically short contact times for packets of fluidized
	particles at the surface of a burning sphere. The result is the new
	correlation for the dependence of Sh on dchar, the diameter of a
	burning char particle. This equation is based on there being a gas-cushion
	of fluidizing gas underneath a burning char particle; the implication
	of this correlation is that a completely new picture emerges for
	the combustion of a char particle in a hot fluidized bed.},

  abstract = {Discrete Diffusion Monte Carlo (DDMC) is a technique for increasing
	the efficiency of Monte Carlo particle-transport simulations in diffusive
	media. If standard Monte Carlo is used in such media, particle histories
	will consist of many small steps, resulting in a computationally
	expensive calculation. In DDMC, particles take discrete steps between
	spatial cells according to a discretized diffusion equation. Each
	discrete step replaces many small Monte Carlo steps, thus increasing
	the efficiency of the simulation. In addition, given that DDMC is
	based on a diffusion equation, it should produce accurate solutions
	if used judiciously. In practice, DDMC is combined with standard
	Monte Carlo to form a hybrid transport-diffusion method that can
	accurately simulate problems with both diffusive and non-diffusive
	regions. In this paper, we extend previously developed DDMC techniques
	in several ways that improve the accuracy and utility of DDMC for
	nonlinear, time-dependent, radiative-transfer calculations. The use
	of DDMC in these types of problems is advantageous since, due to
	the underlying linearizations, optically thick regions appear to
	be diffusive. First, we employ a diffusion equation that is discretized
	in space but is continuous in time. Not only is this methodology
	theoretically more accurate than temporally discretized DDMC techniques,
	but it also has the benefit that a particle's time is always known.
	Thus, there is no ambiguity regarding what time to assign a particle
	that leaves an optically thick region (where DDMC is used) and begins
	transporting by standard Monte Carlo in an optically thin region.
	Also, we treat the interface between optically thick and optically
	thin regions with an improved method, based on the asymptotic diffusion-limit
	boundary condition, that can produce accurate results regardless
	of the angular distribution of the incident Monte Carlo particles.
	Finally, we develop a technique for estimating radiation momentum
	deposition during the DDMC simulation, a quantity that is required
	to calculate correct fluid motion in coupled radiation-hydrodynamics
	problems. With a set of numerical examples, we demonstrate that our
	improved DDMC method is accurate and can provide efficiency gains
	of several orders of magnitude over standard Monte Carlo.},

	2007) with the support of AREVA-NP and IRSN. The NEPTUNE activities
	include software development, research in physical modeling and numerical
	methods, development of advanced instrumentation techniques and new
	experimental programs. Four different simulation scales were addressed
	including DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation), CFD in open medium (Computational
	Fluid Dynamics), component (subchannel-type analysis) and system
	(reactor modeling) scales.
	
	In 2006 CEA, EDF, AREVA-NP and IRSN defined the strategy for the system
	scale of NEPTUNE and the CATHARE-3 development was launched. The
	main objectives are:â€¢ advanced physical modeling of two-phases
	flows, mainly by using multi-field and turbulence models, â€¢ improved
	3D modeling by the use of fine and non conforming structured meshes,
	â€¢ generalized coupling capabilities with other thermal-hydraulic
	scales and with other disciplines (core physics, structural mechanics,
	â€¦), â€¢ extension of the applicability to new Gen IV reactors (Sodium
	Cooled Fast Breeder Reactors, Gas Cooled Reactors, Supercritical
	Light Water Reactors), â€¢ a true object-oriented code architecture.
	
	
	At the same time CATHARE-3 is in continuity with the CATHARE-2 code
	which is the current industrial version of CATHARE and internationally
	used for nuclear power plant safety analysis, in simulators and in
	coupled simulation tools. The road map of these two codes will allow
	a smooth transition from CATHARE-2 to CATHARE-3 for all users.
	
	This paper gives an overview of the choices made for the development
	of CATHARE-3 including new physical models, validation strategy and
	experimental programs, numerical improvements, enhanced coupling
	capability and software architecture evolution. The current status
	of the project as well as the overall schedule will be presented.},

	and a challenging task. The literature on numerical models generally
	concentrates on the theoretical aspects of the numerical method but
	available information on the problems encountered during the implementation
	of such methods for real applications is scarce. The reason is that
	many of these methods are tailored to specific applications and sometimes
	are rather empirical. These techniques are the result of a long and

	The potential threat posed by air ingress lies in the chemical reaction
	of oxygen with hot graphite at a temperature above 500 °C leading
	to reaction heat and graphite corrosion. In order to assess the consequence
	of air ingress into the reactor, it is postulated that breaks are
	present above and below the reactor core and that unobstructed ingress
	of air through them is possible. It is obvious that the air ingress
	incident has to be preceded by a depressurization accident. For this
	hypothetical scenario the maximum possible air flow rate through
	the core resulting solely from the pressure losses in the core is
	estimated as a function of the break cross-sections exposed above
	and below the core. In this paper, the thermal behavior of an HTR
	with prismatic fuel (operating inlet/outlet temperatures 450/850 °C)
	during air ingress accident conditions has been investigated. In
	particular, maximum temperatures and burn-off of the fuel and bottom
	graphite reflector for various air flow rates for the postulated
	hypothetical scenario have been analyzed. It also indicates the limiting
	time at which the graphite layer of fuel will be completely burnt-off
	and the fuel compacts exposed. In addition, the consequences of delayed
	air ingress after a core heat up following depressurization have
	been investigated. This paper, thus, throws light on the safety aspects
	of the new generation HTRs with prismatic fuels (e.g. NGNP/ANTARES)

	paper presents the numerical simulations of the V/HTR using the thermal-hydraulic

	with pebble fuels, verified by experiments, subsequently adopted
	for applications in the HTRs with prismatic fuels and checked against

	(operating inlet/outlet temperatures 490/1000 °C) during post shutdown
	passive cooling under pressurized and depressurized primary system
	conditions has been investigated. Additional investigations have
	also been carried out to determine the influence of other inlet/outlet
	operating temperatures (e.g. 490/850, 350/850 or 350/1000 °C) on

	for all these cases, which is the limiting temperature relating to
	radioactivity release from the fuel. The analyses presented in this

	and chemical reaction on the inner graphite surface, are discussed.
	These differences may be due to the complex pore system in graphite,
	which cannot be approximated by one single diffusivity. Based on
	these theoretical results, a procedure for measurements on candidate
	graphites to be used in PBMR is proposed. Regime I measurements are
	selected for material characterization because of the strong sensitivity
	to chemical influences. First results measured in air at 650-750 °C
	at the Graphite Oxidation Laboratory, GOLab, Research Centre Jülich,
	are outlined. Graphites examined so far are the SGL grades NBG-10

	for all specimens and at all temperatures than the former German
	nuclear graphite V483T5, taken as a standard, the scatter of oxidation
	rates of NBG-18 is even larger, but is on average also satisfactory.
	In contrast to the classical model, preliminary low-temperature oxidation
	experiments on NBG-10 reveal a significant rate dependence on specimen
	size. Additional experiments in regime I and in regime II are proposed

  abstract = {A nonlinear additive Schwarz preconditioned inexact Newton method
	(ASPIN) was introduced recently for solving large sparse highly nonlinear
	systems of equations obtained from the discretization of nonlinear
	partial differential equations. In this paper, we discuss some extensions
	of ASPIN for solving steady-state incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes
	equations with high Reynolds numbers in the velocityâ€“pressure formulation.
	The key idea of ASPIN is to find the solution of the original system
	by solving a nonlinearly preconditioned system that has the same
	solution as the original system, but with more balanced nonlinearities.
	Our parallel nonlinear preconditioner is constructed using a nonlinear
	overlapping additive Schwarz method. To show the robustness and scalability
	of the algorithm, we present some numerical results obtained on a
	parallel computer for two benchmark problems: a driven cavity flow
	problem and a backward-facing step problem with high Reynolds numbers.
	The sparse nonlinear system is obtained by applying a Q1&#xa0;âˆ’&#xa0;Q1
	Galerkin least squares finite element discretization on two-dimensional
	unstructured meshes. We compare our approach with an inexact Newton
	method using different choices of forcing terms. Our numerical results
	show that ASPIN has good convergence and is more robust than the
	traditional inexact Newton method with respect to certain parameters
	such as the Reynolds number, the mesh size, and the number of processors.},

	of this accident scenario is compounded by multiple physical phenomena
	that are involved in the air ingress event. These include diffusion,
	natural circulation, and complex chemical reactions with graphite
	and oxygen. In an attempt to better understand the phenomenon, the
	FLUENT-6 computational fluid dynamics code was used to assess two
	air ingress experiments. The first was the Japanese series of tests
	performed in the early 1990s by Takeda and Hishida. These separate
	effects tests were conducted to understand and model a multi-component
	experiment in which all three processes were included with the introduction
	of air in a heated graphite column. MIT used the FLUENT code to benchmark
	these series of tests with quite good results. These tests are generically
	applicable to prismatic reactors and the lower reflector regions
	of pebble-bed reactors. The second series of tests were performed

	graphite corrosion in case of air ingress accidents in a high-temperature

	of pebble bed reactors by simulating hot and cold legs of these reactors.
	The FLUENT code was also successfully used to simulate these tests.

	soot model. Flame curvature is shown to result in flames that move,
	relative to the fluid, either toward or away from rich soot formation
	regions, resulting in soot being essentially convected into or away
	from the flame. This relative motion of flame and soot results in
	a wide spread of soot in the mixture fraction coordinate. In regions
	where the center of curvature of the flame is in the fuel stream,
	the flame motion is toward the fuel and soot is located near the
	flame at high temperature and hence has higher reaction rates and
	radiative heat fluxes. Soot-flame breakthrough is also observed in
	these regions. Fluid convection and flame displacement velocity relative
	to fluid convection are of similar magnitudes while thermophoretic
	diffusion is 5-10 times lower. These results emphasize the importance
	of both unsteady and multidimensional effects on soot formation and
	transport in turbulent flames.},

	arising in the field of computational fluid dynamics. Primitive variable
	forms of the steady incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes
	and energy equations that describe the flow of a laminar Newtonian

	are obtained by first integrating over discrete finite volumes that
	compose the computational mesh. The resulting system of nonlinear
	algebraic equations are linearized using Newton's method. Preconditioned
	Krylov subspace based iterative algorithms then solve these linear
	systems on each Newton iteration. Selected Krylov algorithms include
	the Amoldi-based Generalized Minimal RESidual (GMRES) algorithm,
	and the Lanczos-based Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS), Bi-CGSTAB,
	and Transpose-Free Quasi-Minimal Residual (TFQMR) algorithms. Both
	Incomplete Lower-Upper @.U) factorization and domain-based additive
	and multiplicative Schwan preconditioning strategies are studied.
	Numerical techniques such as mesh sequencing, adaptive damping, pseudo-transient
	relaxation, and parameter continuation are used to improve the solution
	efficiency, while algorithm implementation is simplified using a
	numerical Jacobian evaluation.
	
	
	The capabilities of standard Newton-Krylov algorithms are demonstrated
	via solutions to both incompressible and compressible flow problems.
	Incompressible flow problems include natural convection in an enclosed
	cavity, and mixdforced convection past a backward facing step. Additionally,
	matrix-free Newton-Krylov implementations are constructed by approximating
	the Jacobian-vector products appearing in the Krylov algorithms with
	finite difference approximations. Performance of the matrix-fiee
	implementation is found to depend upon problem size, problem nonlinearity,
	and Krylov algorithm selection. Higher order accurate solutions for
	mixed convection flow are obtained using the third order cubic upwind
	interpolation scheme (CUI) convection scheme with a defect correction
	procedure and several CPU performance enhancement techniques. Solution
	efficiency for high Reynolds number forced convection flow is investigated
	using a discrete pressure equation formulation, alternative cell
	ordering strategies, and pseudo-transient relaxation. Solutions to

	that have average coolant temperatures above 900 degrees C or operational
	fuel temperatures above 1250 degrees C. These concepts provide the
	potential for increased energy conversion efficiency and for high-temperature
	process heat application in addition to power generation and nuclear
	hydrogen generation. While all the High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor
	(HTGR) concepts have sufficiently high temperatures to support process
	heat applications, such as desalination and cogeneration, the VHTGR's
	higher temperatures are suitable for particular applications such
	as thermochemical hydrogen production. However, the high temperature
	operation can be detrimental to safety following a loss-of-coolant
	accident (LOCA) initiated by pipe breaks caused by seismic or other
	events. Following the loss of coolant through the break and coolant
	depressurization, air from the containment will enter the core by
	molecular diffusion and ultimately by natural convection, leading
	to oxidation of the in-core graphite structures and fuel. The oxidation
	will release heat and accelerate the heatup of the reactor core.
	Thus, without any effective countermeasures, a pipe break may lead
	to significant fuel damage and fission product release. The Idaho
	National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) has investigated
	this event for the past three years for the HTGR. However, the computer
	codes used, and in fact none of the world's computer codes, have
	been sufficiently developed and validated to reliably predict this
	event. New code development, improvement of the existing codes, and
	experimental validation are imperative to narrow the uncertaninty
	in the predictions of this type of accident. The objectives of this
	Korean/United States collaboration are to develop advanced computational
	methods for VHTGR safety analysis codes and to validate these computer

	station blackout cases with different leak rates. In all three cases,
	the hot leg or surge line failed well before the lower head and thus
	the primary system depressurized to a point where DCH was no longer
	considered a threat. However, these calculations were continued to
	lower head failure in order to gain insights that were useful in
	establishing the initial and boundary conditions. The most useful
	insights are that the reactor coolant system pressure is low at vessel
	breach, metallic blockages in the core region do not melt and relocate
	into the lower plenum, and melting of upper plenum steel is correlated
	with hot leg failure. The output was used as input to to assess the
	containment conditions at vessel breach. The containment-side conditions
	predicted by are similar to those originally specified in NUREG/CR-6075.
	The methodology originally developed in NUREG/CR-6075 (M.M. Pilch,

	the new splinter scenarios. Some modeling enhancements in response
	to working group discussions were implemented for these analyses.
	The entrainment of hydrogen pre-existing in the atmosphere into a
	burning jet was examined more carefully. In addition, the impact
	of DCH-induced deflagrations on DCH loads was quantified. A new computational
	tool--the two-cell equilibrium--Latin hypercube sampling (TCE-LHS)
	code--was developed for this effort to perform Monte Carlo sampling
	of the scenario distributions. The TCE-LHS code was benchmarked against
	the original Scenario I calculations in NUREG/CR-6075 performed using
	the code, which is based on the method of discrete probability distributions.
	The results were in excellent agreement. The analyses of the new
	scenarios showed no intersection of the load distributions and the
	containment fragility curves, and thus the containment failure probability
	was negligible for each scenario. These supplemental analyses complete
	closure of the DCH issue for Zion.},

  abstract = {Conventional coupling paradigms currently used to couple different
	physics components in reactor analysis problems can be inconsistent
	in their treatment of the nonlinear terms due to the operator-split
	(OS) strategies employed. This leads to the usage of small time steps
	to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall
	computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques
	that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms
	and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques
	with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied
	for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics
	lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance
	model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made
	to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple
	nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block
	coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is
	carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher
	order Implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these
	results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping
	methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution
	fields than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with
	rapid and discontinuous variations.},

  number = {1},
  abstract = {For some time it has been known that many of the two-phase flow models
	lead to ill-posed Cauchy problems because they have complex characteristic
	values. A necessary condition (at least in the linear case) for the
	Cauchy problem to be well-posed is that it be stable in the sense
	of von Neumann. For systems of partial differential equations of
	first order, stability in the sense of von Neumann is essentially
	equivalent to the condition that the model be hyperbolic (all real
	characteristic values and complete set of characteristic vectors).
	Herein models are developed which have real characteristic values
	for all physically acceptable states (state space) and except for
	a set of measure zero have a complete set of characteristic vectors
	in state space. Therefore, these models are hyperbolic a.e. (almost
	everywhere) in state space. Also, they are stable in the sense of
	von Neumann a.e. in state space even without inclusion of viscosity
	terms. The models discussed herein are developed for the case of
	two-phase separated planar flow and include transverse momentum considerations.
	These models are referred to as â€œtwo-pressureâ€� models because
	each phase is assumed to exist at an average pressure different from
	the average pressure in the other phase; the pressure fields are
	related through momentum considerations. Numerical results on a steady-state
	problem show good agreement with existing steady-state results. Numerical
	results on a transient problem agree with a single-pressure model
	until the onset of numerical instability in the single-pressure model.
	Compared to the single-pressure (hydrostatic) model, the two-pressure
	model approximates additional physical features and is shown to be
	a viable approach for the case of separated flow.},

	However, most correlations apply to situations under a relatively

	even for the data sets on which they are based. In contrast to this
	multitude of correlations, the development of mechanistic models
	based on the underlying physical processes has been sporadic and

	dynamical behaviors of pool nucleate boiling for the purpose of suggesting
	some potential reasons why we have had limited success in mechanistic
	modeling, and to provide a promising perspective on future boiling

	for area averaged one-dimensional two-fluid model is presented. The
	momentum flux parameters for gas and liquid are introduced to incorporate
	the effect of void fraction profiles and velocity profiles. The stability
	of the governing differential equations is determined in terms of
	gas and liquid momentum flux parameters. It is shown that the two-fluid
	model is well posed with certain restrictions on the liquid and gas
	momentum flux parameters. Simplified flow configurations for bubbly
	flow, slug flow, and annular flow are constructed to test the validity
	of proposed stability criteria. The momentum flux parameters are
	calculated for these flow configurations by assuming a power-law
	profile for both velocity and void fraction. Existing correlation
	for volumetric distribution parameter Co is used. By employing simplified
	velocity profiles, the void fraction profile is determined from Co
	correlation. It is found that the void fraction is wall-peaked at
	low void fraction and it becomes center-peaked as the void fraction
	increases. A simplified annular flow is also constructed. With these
	flow configurations, the momentum flux parameters are determined.
	It is shown that the calculated momentum flux parameters are located
	in the stable region above the analytically determined stability
	boundary. The analyses results indicate that the use of momentum
	flux parameter is promising, since they reflect flow structure and
	help to stabilize the governing differential equations.},

	of the gasification and combustion of solid fuel, both coal and biomass
	in the following different systems: - Coal fired non-slagging cyclone
	combustors. - Pre-calciners on cement plant. - Fuel rich inverted
	cyclone combustors used to simulate the time temperature history
	of large utility boilers. - Cyclonic gasifiers for sawdust and direct
	firing of small gas turbines. - Deposition studies for slagging and
	fouling in large utility boilers. - Prediction of final carbon in
	ash from pulverised coal systems. Commercial CFD codes such as Fluent
	are well developed and have well proven routines for lagrangian tracking
	of burning particles through complex flow fields. However what has
	become apparent in numerous studies is that existing models for solid
	fuel combustion can be adjusted to predict the initial flow field
	aerodynamics, sometimes the temperature, but fall down when particles
	have to be followed completely through a system. This is manifested
	with cyclone combustors and gasifiers via enhanced retention of burning
	particles in centrifugal force fields, which can only be resolved
	by changes in the particle size distribution and thus fragmentation
	as the particle gasify or burn. This problem also becomes apparent
	in studies of processes in pre-calciners and in deposition in large
	utility boilers and furnaces. The paper will review the literature
	of the fragmentation of pulverised coal and biomass during gasification,
	devolatilisation and combustion and relate it to observed phenomena
	in the type of system under consideration. The difficulties of incorporating
	models of fragmentation in CFD codes such as Fluent are discussed.
	Then the implementation of such a model in Fluent is described, together
	with results from a number of different systems. It is concluded
	that the model so implemented shows improved prediction in many difficult
	areas, but still needs development to better reflect actual fragmentation
	conditions in different experimental systems. It is concluded that
	the model needs to be further extended beyond the single step fragmentation
	at present used, especially to include many of the fine particles
	known to be generated in such systems.},

	In this paper, a mechanistic model is developed to predict the swelling
	level, the average void fraction, and the pressure transients in
	the case of blow down of steam from a tank. Both the equilibrium
	model and the non-equilibrium model are developed to analyze the
	flashing phenomena in a tank. Thus, in the equilibrium model, detailed
	knowledge of the gas bubble generation and growth is not needed.
	In the case of the non-equilibrium model, liquid can be superheated
	by depressurization, and the bubble generation rate is calculated
	as a function of superheat. By applying a Lagrangian approach, the
	bubble growth rate and the total volume of gas can be calculated.
	Computer programs for the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium models
	are developed. Results are compared with experimental data. For pressure
	and venting rate, the results of both the equilibrium model and the
	non-equilibrium model agree very well with the experimental data.
	The equilibrium model is not accurate in predicting swelling level
	and void fraction because the model does not use detailed information

	results of the proposed non-equilibrium model agree well with the

	was employed. Macroscopic properties, such as surface tension ([sigma])
	and contact angle ([beta]), were implemented through the fluid-fluid
	(G[sigma]) and fluid-solid (Gt) interaction potentials. The model
	was found to possess a linear relation between the macroscopic properties
	([sigma], [beta]) and microscopic parameters (G[sigma], Gt). The
	separate effects of the body force (gravity), gas injection rate,
	surface tension, and wettability were analyzed for both horizontal
	and vertical surfaces. It is shown that results of the lattice-Boltzmann
	modeling exhibit correct parametric dependencies of the departure
	diameter of bubbles generated on the horizontal surface on the above
	factors as previously established in experiments. For the case of
	bubble growth and departure on the vertical surface, the different
	effects of hydrodynamic parameters, except gas generation rate, were
	predicted.},

	application to thermal non-equilibrium two-phase flows in light water
	nuclear reactors (LWRs). A two-fluid three-field model is adopted
	and a multi-dimensional unstructured grid is used for complicated
	geometries. The phase change and the time derivative terms appearing
	in the continuity equations are implemented implicitly in the pressure
	correction step. The energy equations are decoupled from the momentum
	equations for faster convergence. The verification of the present
	numerical method was carried out against a set of test problems which
	includes the single and the two-phase flows. The results are also
	compared to those of the semi-implicit ICE method, where the energy
	equations are coupled with the momentum equation for pressure correction.},

  abstract = {After the nuclear accidents of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl the
	world nuclear community made great efforts to increase research on
	nuclear reactors and to develop advanced nuclear power plants with
	much improved safety features. Following the successful construction
	and a most gratifying operation of the 10 MWth high-temperature gas-cooled
	test reactor (HTR-10), the Institute of Nuclear and New Energy Technology
	(INET) of Tsinghua University has developed and designed an HTR demonstration
	plant, called the HTR-PM (high-temperature-reactor pebble-bed module).
	The design, having jointly been carried out with industry partners
	from China and in collaboration of experts worldwide, closely follows
	the design principles of the HTR-10. Due to intensive engineering
	and R&D efforts since 2001, the basic design of the HTR-PM has been
	finished while all main technical features have been fixed. A Preliminary
	Safety Analysis Report (PSAR) has been compiled. The HTR-PM plant
	will consist of two nuclear steam supply system (NSSS), so called
	modules, each one comprising of a single zone 250 MWth pebble-bed
	modular reactor and a steam generator. The two NSSS modules feed
	one steam turbine and generate an electric power of 210 MW. A pilot
	fuel production line will be built to fabricate 300,000 pebble fuel
	elements per year. This line is closely based on the technology of
	the HTR-10 fuel production line. The main goals of the project are
	two-fold. Firstly, the economic competitiveness of commercial HTR-PM
	plants shall be demonstrated. Secondly, it shall be shown that HTR-PM
	plants do not need accident management procedures and will not require
	any need for offsite emergency measures. According to the current
	schedule of the project the completion date of the demonstration
	plant will be around 2013. The reactor site has been evaluated and
	approved; the procurement of long-lead components has already been
	started. After the successful operation of the demonstration plant,
	commercial HTR-PM plants are expected to be built at the same site.
	These plants will comprise many NSSS modules and, correspondingly,
	a larger turbine.},
