	and Low Mach Number Compressible Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer Problems
	Using Finite Volume Discretization},
  institution = {Idaho National Engineering Laboratory},
  year = {1995},
  number = {INEL-95/0118},
  abstract = {Fully coupled, Newton-Krylov algorithms are investigated for solving
	sttongly coupled, nonlinear systems of partial differential equations
	arising in the field of computational fluid dynamics. Primitive variable
	forms of the steady incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes
	and energy equations that describe the flow of a laminar Newtonian
	fluid in two-dimensions are specifically considered. Numerical solutions
	are obtained by first integrating over discrete finite volumes that
	compose the computational mesh. The resulting system of nonlinear
	algebraic equations are linearized using Newton's method. Preconditioned
	Krylov subspace based iterative algorithms then solve these linear
	systems on each Newton iteration. Selected Krylov algorithms include
	the Amoldi-based Generalized Minimal RESidual (GMRES) algorithm,
	and the Lanczos-based Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS), Bi-CGSTAB,
	and Transpose-Free Quasi-Minimal Residual (TFQMR) algorithms. Both
	Incomplete Lower-Upper @.U) factorization and domain-based additive
	and multiplicative Schwan preconditioning strategies are studied.
	Numerical techniques such as mesh sequencing, adaptive damping, pseudo-transient
	relaxation, and parameter continuation are used to improve the solution
	efficiency, while algorithm implementation is simplified using a
	numerical Jacobian evaluation.
	
	
	The capabilities of standard Newton-Krylov algorithms are demonstrated
	via solutions to both incompressible and compressible flow problems.
	Incompressible flow problems include natural convection in an enclosed
	cavity, and mixdforced convection past a backward facing step. Additionally,
	matrix-free Newton-Krylov implementations are constructed by approximating
	the Jacobian-vector products appearing in the Krylov algorithms with
	finite difference approximations. Performance of the matrix-fiee
	implementation is found to depend upon problem size, problem nonlinearity,
	and Krylov algorithm selection. Higher order accurate solutions for
	mixed convection flow are obtained using the third order cubic upwind
	interpolation scheme (CUI) convection scheme with a defect correction
	procedure and several CPU performance enhancement techniques. Solution
	efficiency for high Reynolds number forced convection flow is investigated
	using a discrete pressure equation formulation, alternative cell
	ordering strategies, and pseudo-transient relaxation. Solutions to
	the compressible flow problem, consisting of low Mach number subsonic
	flow past a backstep, found ILU preconditioners to be strongly sensitive
	to cell ordering and less effective than domain based preconditioners
	at low Mach numbers.},

  volume = {53},
  pages = {124-151},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {For some time it has been known that many of the two-phase flow models
	lead to ill-posed Cauchy problems because they have complex characteristic
	values. A necessary condition (at least in the linear case) for the
	Cauchy problem to be well-posed is that it be stable in the sense
	of von Neumann. For systems of partial differential equations of
	first order, stability in the sense of von Neumann is essentially
	equivalent to the condition that the model be hyperbolic (all real
	characteristic values and complete set of characteristic vectors).
	Herein models are developed which have real characteristic values
	for all physically acceptable states (state space) and except for
	a set of measure zero have a complete set of characteristic vectors
	in state space. Therefore, these models are hyperbolic a.e. (almost
	everywhere) in state space. Also, they are stable in the sense of
	von Neumann a.e. in state space even without inclusion of viscosity
	terms. The models discussed herein are developed for the case of
	two-phase separated planar flow and include transverse momentum considerations.
	These models are referred to as “two-pressure” models because each
	phase is assumed to exist at an average pressure different from the
	average pressure in the other phase; the pressure fields are related
	through momentum considerations. Numerical results on a steady-state
	problem show good agreement with existing steady-state results, Numerical
	results on a transient problem agree
	
	with a single-pressure model until the onset of numerical instability
	in the single-pressure model. Compared to the single-pressure (hydrostatic)
	model, the two-pressure model approximates additional physical features
	and is shown to be a viable approach for the case of separated flow.},

  abstract = {The state of the art in modeling reflooding situations, mainly with
	the two-fluid system analysis codes, is reviewed; certain related
	general code development issues are included. Our current modeling
	of reflooding is reasonable and can be made sufficiently conservative
	for safety assessments, but it is not outstanding. Fundamental understanding
	of the detailed two-phase flow and heat transfer mechanisms has not
	progressed significantly over the state already available several
	years ago.
	
	
	The better understanding of system behavior achieved by the coordinated
	program of large-scale experiments is summarized and its impact on
	the modeling work discussed. In the future, factors such as the additional
	accident scenaria now considered, the new and advanced reactor types
	being analyzed, and the geometric growth of computing capacity are
	likely to drive our efforts. The new requirements and challenges
	can be met best by building into the codes pieces of understanding
	of the actual physical processes at the most fundamental level practicable.
	The discussion focuses on the existing codes and their successes
	and shortcomings; both certain specialized and the more complex general-purpose
	system codes are considered. The aim is not to conduct an exhaustive
	review of all aspects of the problem, but rather to reach consensus
	on certain issues.},
