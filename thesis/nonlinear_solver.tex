\chapter{Nonlinear Solver}
\label{chap:nln_solver}
In order to determine the effects of nonlinear convergence upon the timestep size insensitivity of a solution, the \cobra{} software was modified to enable an iterative global Newton's method.
As part of the \cobra{} modification a novel operator-based scaling has been developed to obtain meaningful convergence thresholds.
The first stage of work was to modify the \cobra{} software.
As obtained, the \cobra{} software used a single-shot linearization of the semi-implicit method.
In order to evaluate the subdomain nonlinear refinement algorithm, \cobra{} ndeeded to be modified to include a fully iterative Newton solver based upon a line search globalization strategy.
When it is necessary to distinguish between the single-shot linearization algorithmic implementation of \cobra{} and the iterative nonlinear \cobra{} implementation, the former shall be referred to as the linear solver and the latter as the nonlinear solver.
As such, the \cobra{} software needed to be modified to be able do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Create a data framework for constructing vector quantities such as $\vec{x}^{k}$ and $\vec{F}$.}
\item{Correctly evaluate $\vec{F}(\vec{x}^{k})$ and $\vec{J}(x^{k})$.}
\item{Develop proper scaling of $\vec{F}(\vec{x}^{k})$.}
\item{Implement a globalization strategy for Newton's method.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Data Conversion}
\label{subsect:nln_conversion}

\cobra{} utilized a single-shot linearization for its solution technique.
As a result of that design decision, memory saving techniques were employed in the construction of the software that precluded more than one Newton step.
In particular, there was the implicit assumption within the software that the first Newton iterate, $\vec{x}^{n+1, 0}$, was the old-time variable $\vec{x}^{n}$.
This design decision required the vetting of all subroutines involved with the evaluation of the components of both the nonlinear residual and its Jacobian.
In addition, the assumption that $\vec{x}^{n+1, k} = \vec{x}^{n}$ produced source code that was inconsistent with an iterative Newton method.
The source code was modified to reflect the intended discretization of the governing conservation laws.
To do this, areas had to be identified where: there were implicit cancellation of terms, the new-time variables were used in place of old-time variables, and the old-time variables were used in place of new-time variables.
Where appropriate, the software was changed to reflect the distinction between old-time and iterate variables and to introduce terms that had been assumed to be equal to zero.

Once the appropriate variables were used for the evaluation of the nonlinear residuals and the Jacobian, a Newton loop was introduced to allow multiple Newton steps.
\alg{alg:nl_cobra} contains the current algorithmic implementation of the nonlinear semi-implicit method.

\end{algorithmic}
\caption{Nonlinear \cobra{} algorithm.}
\label{alg:nl_cobra}
\end{algo}

In \alg{alg:nl_cobra}, there are three steps that require discussion.
First is the Newton Loop termination criteria.
There are three Newton loop termination mechanisms, listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{$k > k_{\,\text{MAX}}$}
\item{$||(\vec{S}^{k+1})^{-1}\vec{F}^{k+1}||_{\infty} \leq F_{\text{ABS}}$}
\item{$||(\vec{D}^{k+1})^{-1}\vec{\delta x}^{k}||_{\infty} \leq \delta_{\text{ABS}}$}
\end{enumerate}

Current values for $k_{\,\text{MAX}}$, $F_{\text{ABS}}$ and $\delta_{\text{ABS}}$ are $35$, $1.0$E$-05$, and $1.0$E$-10$, respectively.
The scaling vectors, $\vec{S}$ and $\vec{D}$, will be addressed later.

The second is the globalization loop termination criteria.
The globalization strategy implemented in \cobra{} is a line search algorithm \cite{Dennis1996}.
The two globalization loop termination criteria are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{$\frac{1}{2}||\vec{F}^{k+1, j}||^{2}_{2} < \frac{1}{2}||\vec{F}^{k}||^{2}_{2} - \alpha ||\vec{F}^{k}||^{2}_{2}$ }
\item{$||\lambda_{j+1} \vec{\delta x}^{k}||_{\infty} < \delta_{\text{abs}}$}
\end{enumerate}

The third point requiring discussion is the calculation of the Newton update vector.
If neither of the loop termination criteria are met, then a step-length parameter, $\lambda_j$, is calculated.
On the first pass through the globalization loop within a given Newton step, a quadratic backtracking model is adopted.
On subsequent passes, a cubic-backtracking model is used.
 
Since vector forms of the nonlinear residual and the independent parameters are used in determining nonlinear convergence and in the globalization algorithm, they needed to be easily manipulated.
A subroutine was written to gather the discrete variables of the independent parameters into a single vector.
Additional source code modifications were necessary to construct and gather the components of the nonlinear residual.

The development of the nonlinear solver within \cobra{} took place under strict quality assurance guidelines.
At every step of the development, the linear solver was required to maintain the same solution.
This verification was dependent upon a larger number of verification and assessment problems.
The output of the unmodified \cobra{} and the modified \cobra{} software was compared to machine precision.
It was required that either the results of the two simulations be identical or that the reason for the difference be identified and understood.
The \cobra{} software has the ability to repeat a time-step.
As such, it was required that the backup capabilities continued to work while nonlinear solver was being implemented.
Additionally, testing was done to ensure that the ability to restart the software mid-simulation was unaffected.
While adding time to the development cycle, the overhead of the quality assurance procedures ensured that the linear solver could continue to be used for design purposes.

\section{Operator-Based Scaling}
\label{sect:nln_solver:os}
In order to determine the degree to which a state vector, $\vec{x}$, satisfies the governing PDEs, \eqref{eqn:conservation_equations}, the use of the nonlinear residual, $\vec{F})(\vec{x})$, is required.
Due to the units of the residuals for the different conservation equations, the values of the residuals can vary by orders of magnitude.
For a given continuity volume, the nonlinear residual will have six components: four for the conservation of mass and two for the conservation of energy.
For each momentum volume, the three conservation of momentum equations will form the three components of the nonlinear residual.
These residuals have the units of the conserved quantities for their corresponding PDEs; \tab{tab:scaling_units_scales} shows the units for the different conservation equations.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\input{tables/residuals_and_units}
\caption{Residuals and their units.}
\label{tab:scaling_units_scales}
\end{table}

Due to the range of magnitudes of these residuals it is important to choose a proper scaling factor to ensure that the convergence of each equation is relative to their magnitude.
A challenge that has been addressed in this work is the development of a method for scaling of these residuals that is based upon the physics of interest during a timestep.
In constructing this scaling factor it was determined that the following characteristics were desirable:

\begin{itemize}
\item{$(S_{i}^{k})^{-1} F^{k}_i \approx 1$ when $\vec{x}^{k}$ is a "poor" solution.}
\item{$(S_{i}^{k})^{-1} F^{k}_i \rightarrow 0$ when phase $i$ disappears.}
\item{$0 \leq \abs{(S_{i}^{k})^{-1} F^{k}_{i}} \leq 1 $ for all values of $\vec{x}^{k}_i$.}
\end{itemize}

The scaling used in this work is an operator-based approach.
The governing PDEs can be viewed as a collection of operators, both linear and nonlinear, acting upon the vector of independent parameters.
The summation of these operators must balance to zero for the nonlinear equation to be satisfied.

To illustrate the scaling procedure, we shall consider the discrete conservation of continuous liquid mass \eqref{eqn:si_mass_liq}.
The residual for \eqref{eqn:si_mass_liq} would be \eqref{eqn:res_mass_liq}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:res_mass_liq}
F_{m,l} = \Delta t \left[ V_c \frac{\left(\alpha_l \rho_l \right)^{n+1} - \left(\alpha_l \rho_l \right)^{n}}{\Delta t} + \sum_{NK}\left( \don{\alpha^n_l \rho^n_l}^{n}_{d} u^{n+1}_l  \cdot \vec{\bar{A}}\right) + \left[(1-\eta)\Gamma + S \right]^{n+1}\right]
\end{equation}

In this equation there are five physically meaningful quantities: the temporal difference, the mass flowing into  the volume, the mass flowing out of the volume, the mass exchange with the gaseous phase, and the mass exchange with the entrained liquid field.

The scaling chosen for this residual is shown by \eqref{eqn:scaling_factor}.
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:scaling_factor}
S_{m,l} = \Delta t \left[ V_c \abs{\frac{\left(\alpha_l \rho_l \right)^{n+1} - \left(\alpha_l \rho_l \right)^{n}}{\Delta t}} + \sum_{NK}\abs{\left( \don{\alpha^n_l \rho^n_l}^{n}_{d} u^{n+1}_l  \cdot \vec{\bar{A}}\right)} + \left[\abs{(1-\eta)\Gamma} + \abs{S} \right]^{n+1}\right]
\end{equation}

This scaling creates a relative measure of the nonlinear residual when compared to the magnitude of the physics involved in the process.
The other mass, energy, and momentum equations each have similarly defined scaling factors for their respective residuals.
For convergence testing in the nonlinear version of \cobra{} and residual evaluation during the linear mode, the scaled nonlinear residual is used.

The issue of phase transition was considered during this work.
Since \cobra{} does not actually transition the governing equations to those for single-phase flow, there will always be a nonlinear residual for those phases that are approximately absent.
It was determined that the effects of maintaining a depleted phase in the system of equations when solving the nonlinear problem created a unique issue.
The unscaled residuals would be on the order of machine round-off.
The operator based scaling factors for these residuals would also be within orders of magnitude of machine round-off.
This created the situation where the scaled nonlinear residual for the depleted field would be of $\mathcal{O}$(1).
These depleted residuals would dominate the determination of convergence.
To overcome this deficiency it was determined that when a phase or field began to deplete, the scaling factor would be scaled up to create an artificial decrease in the residual to counter the artificial presence of the depleted field.
This scaling is shown by \eqref{eqn:scaling_factor_small}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:scaling_factor_small}
S_k = \max[1.0, \left(C_1 \frac{\alpha_{k,\text{MIN}}}{\alpha_k}\right)^{C_2} ] S_k
\end{equation}

For this work, the constant $C_1$ was set equal to 100, and the exponent $C_2$ was set equal to 10.
This particular phase transition scaling produced the regular operator scaling factor when the volume fraction of a phase is at least two orders of magnitude greater than the minimum volume fraction for that phase.
This drove the scaled residuals for phases that were nominally not present to zero.
The original coding of \cobra{} has a minimum volume fraction of $\alpha_{k,\text{MIN}}$ = 1.0E-6.
For the work performed here, that value was reduced to $\alpha_{k,\text{MIN}}$ = 1.0E-9.

\section{Convergence Metric}
\label{sect:temporal_convergence}

An important factor in thermal-hydraulic safety analysis is the temporal convergence of the solution.
A definition for a temporally converged solution is required.
In theory, a temporally converged solution is one where the local truncation error due to the discrete approximation of the temporal integral is orders of magnitude below both the engineering scales of interest and precision of the physical models being used in the simulation.
Unfortunately, the precise measurement of the error in a simulation requires that an analytic solution be available for comparison.
During the simulation of physically realistic systems, there is rarely an analytic solution against which to compare.
This situation requires a slightly different definition of a temporally converged solution --- a definition that does not depend upon accurately measuring the local truncation error.

An alternative definition for temporal convergence could be ``as the timestep size is reduced, the change in the solution is small enough."
While commonly used, this definition is subjective.
Traditionally, ``change in solution" is addressed in a very qualitative manner.
Engineering judgment of which parameters of the solution are of interest is required.
These parameters may include items of regulatory concern such as peak clad temperature or peak system pressure.
Examining only engineering parameters of interest is a weakness.
This locality means that the entire solution domain is not being considered.
Depending upon the context in which the work is being done, the degree of ``small enough" may be nothing more than looking at a graph of the parameter of interest and using engineering judgment to say that ``those two graphs look about the same."
In some cases, a more quantifiable measure may be used.
An example of a quantifiable metric would be if two simulations with different \dtmax{} are classified as dissimilar if the two solutions produce a ``calculated peak fuel cladding temperature different by more than $50\,^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$" \cite{CFR10}.

While it may be that the change in the chosen parameters of interest does not exceed the limits placed upon it as the timestep size is refined, that behavior does not imply that the solution obtained is the solution to the discrete nonlinear problem.
A metric that can quantify the degree to which the obtained solution satisfies the nonlinear system of equations would be of great value.
The previously mentioned work into nonlinear convergence shows that a solution may be timestep size insensitive but not be the converged solution of the discretized problem \cite{Knoll2001}.
If the nonlinearities of the discrete governing equations are not resolved, then the temporal convergence rate can be degraded.
This degradation can produce results that qualitatively appear to be converged due to an almost zeroth order of temporal accuracy.
In practice, the timestep size insensitivity of a solution is often interpreted as temporal convergence.
This apparent temporal convergence, or timestep size insensitivity, of the solution may not be a result of reaching the solution to the discretized nonlinear equations, but instead could be indicative of the degraded order of accuracy due to the failure to resolve the nonlinearities at each timestep.
To determine if the timestep size insensitive transient solution is both timestep size insensitive and an accurate solution to the nonlinear problem, it is necessary to examine the nonlinear convergence of the system as an issue separate from the temporal-convergence.

The norm of the scaled residual from \sect{sect:nln_solver:os} provides a well-scaled metric for instantaneous nonlinear convergence at any given time in the simulation.
The residual vector norm is divided by the number of equations in the residual to provide an average residual value per equation.
This equation-averaged scaled residual provides a metric for determining the degree of nonlinear convergence at any timestep in the simulation.
The natural extension of this metric to transient problems would be a temporal integral, \eqref{eqn:trans_res_simple}, of said norm.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trans_res_simple}
R = \int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} ||\vec{F}(\tau)||_2 \,\mathrm{d} \tau
\end{equation}

Given the bounds of the scaled residual it was considered desirable to have a similarly scaled transient residual.
The transient residual in \eqref{eqn:trans_res_simple} possesses a dependence upon the number of timesteps taken.
To remove this dependence, a temporal average was instead investigated, \eqref{eqn:trans_res_ave}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trans_res_ave}
\tilde{R} = \frac{\int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} ||\vec{F}(\tau)||_2 \,\mathrm{d} \tau}{t^{N} - t^{0}}
\end{equation}

This metric possesses the desirable bounds $0 \leq R \leq 1$.
Other weighted temporal integrals were considered, such as a simple moment about $t^{0}$, \eqref{eqn:trans_res_mom}.
However, this moment has the disadvantage of weighting the latter portion of the transient greater than the early portion.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trans_res_mom}
\tilde{R}_{\text{M}} = \frac{\int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} \,\tau\,||\vec{F}(\tau)||_2 \,\mathrm{d} \tau}{\int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} \,\tau \,\mathrm{d} \tau}
\end{equation}

\section{Illustrative Problems}
\label{sect:nln_solver:illustrative}

Two test problems were developed to illustrate the effectiveness of the nonlinear solver and the operator based scaling.

\subsection{Geometry}
\label{subsect:experimental_geometry}
For both of the test problems, the same computational geometry was used;  \fig{fig:exp_geometry} represents the experimental geometry.
Each block represents a single continuity cell with a height of 4 [in].
The total height of the channel is 48 [in].
Each continuity cell has a cross-sectional area of 4 [in$^2$].
The red block at the top of the channel represents a boundary cell where the pressure and enthalpy are specified.
It represents an infinite reservoir filled with a fluid at a specified thermodynamic state.
The red triangle represents a specified flow at the bottom edge of the first continuity cell. 

\begin{figure}[h!t]
\centering
\input{images/scaling_test_problem_geometry}
\caption{Geometry for test problems.}
\label{fig:exp_geometry}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Initial and Boundary Conditions}
\label{subsect:ic_bc}

The two problems, while having the same geometry, are different in their dominant physics.
One problem was designed to simulate single-phase, single-field continuous liquid flow in a standpipe.
This problem will be referred to as the single-phase problem.
The second problem was designed such that high-pressure liquid flashes into steam as it enters a standpipe initially filled with saturated vapor at a much lower pressure, known hereafter as the flashing problem.

Table \ref{tab:ic} provides the initial conditions for the two problems.
The pressure, enthalpy, and volume-fractions for the different fields allow for a complete description of the continuity variables.
The initial velocities are set to zero.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\input{tables/nln_ic}
\caption{Initial conditions for test problems.}
\label{tab:ic}
\end{table}

Each of the problems has a specified pressure-enthalpy boundary condition at the top of the stand pipe and a flow-enthalpy boundary condition at the inlet of the domain.
Table \ref{tab:bc_pe} contains the pressure, enthalpy, and composition of the pressure-enthalpy reservoir. 

\begin{table}[h!t]
\centering
\input{tables/nln_bc_outflow}
\caption{The pressure-enthalpy outlet boundary conditions for test problems.}
\label{tab:bc_pe}
\end{table}

The flow-enthalpy boundary condition describes the thermodynamic state of the inflowing fluid and its flow rate.
Table \ref{tab:bc_fe} describes the inlet boundary condition for the two problems.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\input{tables/nln_bc_inflow}
\caption{The flow-enthalpy inlet boundary conditions for test problems.}
\label{tab:bc_fe}
\end{table}

The specified mass flow, $\dot{m}(t)$, at the bottom of the channels is the same for both problems. 
This time-dependent function is given by \eqref{eqn:bc_time_func_single}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:bc_time_func_single}
\dot{m}(t) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cclrcll}
 0.0           & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , &                & t & \leq 1 & [\text{s}] \\
 0.5 ( t - 1)  & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , & 1\; [\text{s}] < & t & \leq 2 & [\text{s}] \\
 0.5           & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , &                & t & > 2    & [\text{s}]
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

Both problems adjust their initial pressure distribution to account for hydrostatic head, which is not specified in the input files.
The \cobra{} input files for both problems can be found in \app{app:input_decks}.

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{subsect:procedures}

The two problems were set up so that the maximum allowable timestep was varied.
Each problem was run with the following maximum allowable timesteps: 1 [s], 0.1 [s], 0.01 [s], 0.001 [s], 0.0001 [s], and 0.00001 [s]. 
For the linear runs, the scaled residuals were evaluated after a single Newton step, $\vec{F}(\vec{x}^{1})$.
For the nonlinear runs, the scaled nonlinear residuals were evaluated at the end of the Newton-loop.
The nonlinear convergence criteria used in the nonlinear solver are described in \sect{sect:nln_solver:cobra}.
The temporal convergence metric was evaluated during post-processing.
In total, there were twenty-four simulations run.
The two different problems were each run at six different maximum timestep sizes on each of the two versions of \cobra{}.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsect:results}

The results from the simulation runs will now be analyzed to determine the impact of nonlinear convergence upon time-step size sensitivity.
The solutions produced by both solvers will be compared to determine the efficacy of the residual metric in determining the validity of the nonlinear solution.  

Of the twenty-four simulations run, the linear solver solution of the flashing problem with a \dtmax{} of 1 [s] failed to run to completion.
The timestep limiting procedure outlined in  \sect{sect:algorithmic_concerns} was unable to prevent too large a change in the independent parameters by reducing the timestep.
This caused the problem to try to run below the minimum allowable timestep size, which resulted in the software aborting.
However, the nonlinearly convergent \cobra{} was able to run at a \dtmax{} of 1 [s].
Both versions of \cobra{} are subject to the same limits on change of independent variables.

For the flashing problem, the parameter of interest for temporal convergence testing is $\alpha_g$ at 2 [in] from the inlet of the stand pipe.
\fig{fig:flashing_1em1} shows the gaseous volume fraction 2 [in] from the inlet of the stand pipe as a function of time for a \dtmax{} of 1.0E-1 [s] for both the linear and the nonlinear solvers.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{plots/flashing_1em1.eps}
\caption{Flashing solution at \dtmax{} = 1.0E-1 {[s]}}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{plots/flashing_1em5.eps}
\caption{Flashing solution at \dtmax{} = 1.0E-5 {[s]}.}
\label{fig:flashing_1em5}
\end{figure}

Note that the nonlinearly resolved solution is qualitatively different than the linear single-shot solution, \fig{fig:flashing_1em1}.
Even as the \dtmax{} is reduced, this discrepancy does not disappear, \fig{fig:flashing_1em5}.
The two solutions do not converge to the same solution as the timestep size was reduced.
However, the solution to the flashing problem produced by the nonlinear solver, \fig{fig:nl_mode_flashing}, qualitatively varies less as the timestep size is reduced than that produced by the linear solver, \fig{fig:cobra_mode_flashing}.
However, both \fig{fig:cobra_mode_flashing} and \fig{fig:nl_mode_flashing} show that as the timestep size is reduced the two different solutions become more timestep size insensitive.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{plots/lin_flashing_al_2in.eps}
\caption{Linear solver flashing solution.}

\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{plots/nln_flashing_al_2in.eps}
\caption{Nonlinear solver flashing solution.}
\label{fig:nl_mode_flashing}
\end{figure}

The two solvers, when applied to the same problem that contains highly nonlinear physics, produce two different timestep size invariant solutions.
These two solutions achieve qualitative timestep size invariance at different timestep sizes.
The parameter of interest in the solution produced by the nonlinear solver with a 1 [s] \dtmax{} is qualitatively close to that produced with a 0.1 [s] \dtmax{}, \fig{fig:nl_flashing_compare}.
The same level of qualitative timestep size invariance is achieved in the linear solver solutions between a \dtmax{} of 1.0E-3 [s] and 1.0E-4 [s], \fig{fig:cobra_flashing_compare}.

\begin{figure}[h!bt]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{plots/nln_flashing_1em0_1em1.eps}

\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{plots/lin_flashing_1em1_1em4.eps}
\caption{Linear solver timestep size insensitive flashing solution.}
\label{fig:cobra_flashing_compare}
\end{figure}

The timestep size insensitive solution produced by the nonlinear solver occurs at a maximum timestep size three orders of magnitude greater than that achieved by the linear solver in \cobra{}.
An examination of the nonlinear residual over the course of the transient provides insight into why this behavior is observed.
The scaled residual for the linear flashing problem indicates that, even for small timestep sizes, the solution obtained still does not satisfy the discrete nonlinear equations, \fig{fig:linear_flashing_residual}.
This is in contrast to the nonlinear flashing problem, which shows a lower residual over the course of the simulation, \fig{fig:nonlinear_flashing_residual}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{plots/lin_flashing_res_compare.eps}
\caption{Residual of the flashing solution for the linear solver.}
\label{fig:linear_flashing_residual}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{plots/nln_flashing_res_compare.eps}
\caption{Residual of the flashing solution for the nonlinear solver.}
\label{fig:nonlinear_flashing_residual}
\end{figure}

The reduction in the residual exhibited by the solution produced by the linear solver, \fig{fig:linear_flashing_residual}, shows that the reduction of the maximum allowable timestep size now serves two purposes.
The first is that as \dtmax{} is reduced the nonlinear physics are being better resolved; however, even for small \dtmax{}, the residuals are still large compared to those of the nonlinear solution, \fig{fig:nonlinear_flashing_residual}.
The second purpose in reducing \dtmax{} is to decrease the error due to the discrete approximation of the temporal integral of the governing equations.
While the reduction of the maximum timestep size in the linear solver serves the purpose of reducing the residual, the nonlinear solver performs this task naturally.
Therefore, in the nonlinear solver the reduction of the maximum timestep size primarily serves to reduce the error from the approximate discrete temporal integral.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{plots/single_1em0.eps}
\caption{Single-phase solution with \dtmax{} = 1.0 {[s]}.}
\label{fig:single_1em1}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{plots/single_1em5.eps}
\caption{Single-phase solution with \dtmax{} = 1.0E-5 {[s]}.}
\label{fig:single_1em5}
\end{figure}

The single-phase case was designed to test if the linear solver produced a simulation result that was equivalent to that produced by the nonlinear solver.
More specifically, it was designed to show that for problems where the physics of interest have relatively low nonlinearities, the linear solver provides as accurate a solution as the nonlinear solver.
\fig{fig:single_1em1} and \fig{fig:single_1em5} show the solution produced by both the nonlinear and linear solvers of \cobra{}.
Unlike the flashing problem, both solvers were able to solve the problem for all of the \dtmax{} specified.
The solutions produced by both solvers are qualitatively equivalent at \dtmax{} = 1.0 [s] and \dtmax{} = 1.0E-5 [s].
This indicates that the linear solver is adequate in regions where the solution is not highly nonlinear.

One way to quantify the difference between the solutions is by measuring the residual convergence metrics outlined in \sect{sect:temporal_convergence}.
These metrics provide a measure of how poorly the discrete nonlinear equations are being solved at every timestep in the transient.
The resolution of the residual allows for a solution that is less sensitive to timestep size selection than for a solution that does not resolve the residual.
The convergence metrics will be used to determine if a qualitative temporal-convergence determination can lead to the acceptance of a solution that is not nonlinearly converged.

For each of the test cases, the two different metrics were compared at the different \dtmax{}.
To examine efficacy of the the temporal convergence criteria, both the average and moment based temporal convergence criteria were evaluated for each of the twenty-three successful simulations.
The values of these metrics will be compared between different solvers for the same test problem. 

The two different nonlinear convergence metrics will now be examined for the flashing problem.
\tab{tab:flashing_criteria} shows both the average metric, $\tilde{R}$, and the moment based metric, $\tilde{R}_{\text{M}}$.
The entry for the linear mode solution at 1 [s] is empty, reflecting its inability to solve the problem.
For the nonlinear solver, both metrics are decreasing as the \dtmax{} is decreased.
While the linear solver also shows a decreasing residual metric, it does not decrease in order-of-magnitude, indicating that as the \dtmax{} is reduced the nonlinearities in the problem are not being sufficiently resolved.

\tab{tab:single_criteria} shows the two metrics for the single-phase problem.
Since the single-phase problem is relatively linear, the linear solver produces metrics that are on the same order as those for the nonlinear solver.
Due to the non-convergence of the nonlinear solver at \dtmax{} = 1.0E-3, the moment based metric for the nonlinear solver is greater than the equivalent linear solver metric.
