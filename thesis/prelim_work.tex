\section{Nonlinear \cobra{}}
\label{sect:nl_cobra}
The first stage of preliminary work was to modify the \cobra{} software.
The \cobra{} software as obtained was a single-shot linearization version of the semi-implicit method.
In order to evaluate the spatially-selective nonlinear refinement, \cobra{} needed to be converted to a fully iterative nonlinear solver.
When it is necessary to distinguish between the single-shot linearization algorithmic implementation of \cobra{} and the iterative nonlinear \cobra{}, the former shall be referred to as legacy mode and the latter as nonlinear mode.
As such, the objectives of this work were to modify the software to be able do the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{Create a data framework for constructing vector quantities such as $\vec{x}^{k}$ and $\vec{F}$.}
\item{Correctly evaluate $\vec{F}(\vec{x}^{k})$ and $\vec{J}(x^{k})$.}
\item{Implement a globalization strategy for Newton's method.}
\end{itemize}

\cobra{} utilized a single-shot linearization Newton method for its solution technique.
As a result of that design decision, certain memory saving techniques were employed in its construction that precluded the idea of more than one Newton step.
In particular, there was an implicit assumption within the software that the current Newton iterate, $\vec{x}^{n+1, 0}$, was the old-time variable $\vec{x}^{n}$.
This design decision required an an evaluation of all routines involved with the evaluation of components of both the nonlinear residual and the Jacobian.
In addition, the assumption that $\vec{x}^{n+1, k} = \vec{x}^{n}$ required identification of places in the source code where there were implicit cancellation of terms.
Where appropriate, the software was changed to reflect the distinction between old-time and iterate variables and to introduce terms that had been assumed to be equal to zero.

Once the appropriate variables were used for the evaluation of nonlinear residuals and Jacobians, a Newton loop was introduced to allow multiple Newton steps.
\alg{alg:nl_cobra} contains the current algorithmic implementation of the nonlinear semi-implicit method.

		\EndIf
	\EndLoop
	\State $n = n + 1$
\EndLoop
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algo}

In \alg{alg:nl_cobra}, there are three steps that require discussion.
First is the Newton Loop termination criteria.
There are three Newton loop termination mechanisms, listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Maximum number of Newton iterates, $k_{\,\text{MAX}}$, exceeded.}
\item{The L-inf norm of the scaled residual, $||\vec{S}^{-1}\vec{F}||_{\infty}$, is below a specified threshold, $F_{\text{ABS}}$.}
\item{The L-inf norm of the scaled update, $||\vec{D}^{-1}\vec{\delta x}||_{\infty}$, is below a specified threshold, $\delta_{\text{ABS}}$.}
\end{enumerate}

Current values for $k_{\,\text{MAX}}$, $F_{\text{ABS}}$ and $\delta_{\text{ABS}}$ are $35$, $1.0$E$-05$, and $1.0$E$-10$, respectively.
The scaling vectors, $\vec{S}$ and $\vec{D}$, will be addressed later.

The globalization strategy implemented in \cobra{} is a linesearch algorithm \cite{Dennis1996}.
The two globalization loop termination criteria are listed below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{$\frac{1}{2}||\vec{F}^{k+1, j}||_{2} < \frac{1}{2}||\vec{F}^{k}||_{2} - \alpha ||\vec{F}^{k}||_{2}$ }
\item{$||\lambda_{j+1} \vec{\delta x}||_{\infty} < \delta_{\text{abs}}$}
\end{enumerate}

If neither of the loop termination criteria are met, then the a step-length parameter, $\lambda_j$ is calculated.
On the first pass through the globalization loop within a given Newton step, a quadratic backtracking model is adopted.
On subsequent passes, a cubic-backtracking model is used.
 
Since vector forms of the nonlinear residual and the independent parameters are used in determining nonlinear convergence and in the globalization algorithm, they needed to be easily manipulated.
A subroutine was written to gather the discrete variables of the independent parameters into a single vector.
Additional source code modifications were necessary to construct and gather the components of the nonlinear residual.

\section{Operator-Based Scaling}
\label{sect:operator_scaling}
In order to determine the degree to which a state vector, $\vec{x}$, satisfies \eqref{eqn:conservation_equations}, the use of the nonlinear residual, $\vec{F}$, is required.
However, due to the formulation of the residual vector, their values can vary by orders of magnitude.
For a given grid location, the nonlinear residuals for mass and energy as formulated in section \ref{subsect:semi_implicit} will have six components.
These residuals will have the units of the conserved quantities for their corresponding PDEs.
Table \ref{tab:scaling_units_scales} shows the range of parameters possible within \cobra{}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{@{}c@{}} \toprule
Scales \\
\bottomrule  
\end{tabular}
\caption{Typical scale for reactor simulations}
\label{tab:scaling_units_scales}
\end{table}

However, during accident scenarios, the range of these values can dramatically change.
One of the challenges that has been addressed during this work is developing a method for scaling that will provide a meaningful metric for convergence.
The scaling chosen should have the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
\item{$S^{-1}_k F(x_k)_i \approx 1$ when $x_k$ is a "poor" solution.}
\item{$S^{-1}_k F(x_k)_i \rightarrow 0$ when a phase disappears.}
\item{$0 \leq S^{-1}_k F(x_k)_i \leq 1 $ for all values of $F(x_k)_i$.}
\end{itemize}

The heart of the scaling used in this work is a physics-based method.
To illustrate the scaling procedure, we shall consider \eqref{eqn:conservation_of_liq} for a simply connected continuity cell without inter-field mass transfer.
Assume that the entire channel single phase and in thermodynamics equilibrium such that the macroscopic densities on either side of this single cell are the same.

\begin{equation}
F = \left(\alpha_k \rho_k\right)^{n+1} - \left( \alpha_k \rho_k \right)^n - \frac{\Delta t}{V} \left( \frac{\alpha_k \rho_k }{<\alpha_k \rho_k>^n} V^{n+1}_{j-1} \right)
\end{equation}

In this equation there are three physically meaningful quantities: the temporal difference, the mass flowing into the cell, and mass flowing out of the volume. 

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:scaled_residual}
2 + 2 = 4
\end{equation}

\section{Temporal Convergence}
\label{sect:temporal_convergence}


Define time-step size insensitivity.
Ideally, the definition would be the following.
As the time-step size is reduce, the numerical solution does not change.
However, due to the finite precision of computers, this is an unrealistic definition.
Another possible definition: as the time-step size is reduced, the change in the solution is small enough.
This a very subjective definition.
What do "as the time-step size is reduce," "change in solution," and "small enough" mean?
Traditionally, "change in solution" is addressed in a very qualitative manner.
Engineering judgment of which parameters of the solution are of interest is required.
Traditionally, these parameters may include items such as peak clad temperature or peak system pressure.
These definition of solution in this case is local.
This locality means that the entire solution domain is not being considered in the definition "change in solution."
This choice of parameters be a more apt definition for "the engineering parameter of interest."

The next definition is for "small enough."
Depending upon the context in which the work is being done, this may be nothing more than looking at a graph of the parameter of interest and using engineering judgment to say "those two graphs look pretty similar."
Or, a more quantifiable measure may be used.
Small enough may be "peak clad temperature does not change by more than 50$\deg$.
Neither of these metrics address questions of rate of change.

The last definition, "as the time-step size is reduced" is a very amorphous statement.
This statement could be interpreted as "over the range of time-steps considered."
While it may be that the chosen metric does not change with modest time-step refinement, that does not imply that the solution obtained is either correct or time-step size insensitive.

As stated in \sect{subsect:temporal_approx}, if the nonlinearities of the discrete governing equations are not resolved, then temporal convergence can be degraded.
This degradation can produce results that qualitatively appear to be converged.
This apparent convergence, or time-step size insensitivity, is not a result of reaching a time-step size insensitive solution, but instead is indicative of the degraded order of accuracy due to the failure to resolve the nonlinearities at each time-step.
With the first-order methods outlined in \sect{sect:solution_techniques}, this degradation can result in methods that are approximately zeroth order \cite{Knoll2001}.
To determine if the transient solution is both time-step size insensitive and an accurate solution to the nonlinear problem, a quantifiable metric is sought.

The scaled residual from \sect{sect:operator_scaling} provides a well-scaled metric for instantaneous nonlinear convergence at any given time in the simulation.
The natural extension of this metric would be a temporal integral of the global nonlinear residual, \eqref{eqn:trans_res_simple}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trans_res_simple}
\vec{R} = \int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} ||\vec{F}(\tau)||_2 \,\mathrm{d} \tau
\end{equation}

Given the bounds of the scaled residual, \eqref{eqn:scaled_residual}, it was considered desirable to have a similarly scaled transient residual.
The transient residual in \eqref{eqn:trans_res_simple} possesses a dependence upon the number of time-steps taken.
To remove this dependence, a temporal average was instead investigated, \eqref{eqn:trans_res_ave}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trans_res_ave}
\vec{R} = \frac{\int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} ||\vec{F}(\tau)||_2 \,\mathrm{d} \tau}{t^{N} - t^{0}}
\end{equation}

This metric possesses the desirable bound stated above.
Other weighted temporal integrals were considered, such as a simple moment about $t^{0}$, \eqref{eqn:trans_res_mom}.
However, this moment has the the theoretical disadvantage of weighting the latter portion of the transient.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:trans_res_mom}
\vec{R} = \frac{\int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} \,\tau\,||\vec{F}(\tau)||_2 \,\mathrm{d} \tau}{\int_{t^{0}}^{t^{N}} \,\tau \,\mathrm{d} \tau}
\end{equation}

For the preliminary work, the \eqref{eqn:trans_res_ave} and \eqref{eqn:trans_res_mom} were selected for evaluation.

\section{Numerical Experiments}
\label{sect:numerical_experiments}

In order to evaluate the interplay between the nonlinear solver implementation, the scaling metric, and the temporal convergence criteria, two test problems were constructed.
These tests problems were designed to answer the following three questions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Does the nonlinear solver produce correct results?}
\item{Does the temporal convergence metric provide a quantifiable measure of time-step size insensitivity?}
\item{Does the single-shot linearization have temporal convergence properties similar to the nonlinear solver in the absence of "strong" nonlinearities?}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Geometry}
\label{subsect:experimental_geometry}
For both of the test problems, the same computational geometry was used;  \fig{fig:exp_geometry} represents the experimental geometry.
Each block represents a single continuity cell with a height of 4 [in].
The total height of the channel is 48 [in].
Each continuity cell has a cross-sectional area of 4 [in$^2$] and a hydraulic diameter of 4 [in].
The red block at the top of the channel represents a boundary cell where the pressure and enthalpy are specified.
It represents an infinite reservoir filled with a fluid at a specified thermodynamic state.
The red triangle represents a specified flow at the bottom edge of the first continuity cell.

\subsection{Initial and Boundary Conditions}
\label{subsect:ic_bc}

The two problems, while having the same geometry, are different in their dominant physics.
One problem was designed to simulate single-phase, single-field continuous liquid flow in a standpipe; this problem will be referred to as the "Single Phase" problem.
The second problem was designed such that high-pressure liquid flashes into steam as it enters a standpipe initially filled with saturated vapor at a much lower pressure, known hereafter as the "Flashing" problem.

Table \ref{tab:ic} provides the initial conditions for the two problems.
The pressure, enthalpy, and volume-fractions for the different fields allows for a complete description of the continuity variables.
The initial velocities are set to zero.

\end{equation}

Both problems adjust their initial pressure distribution to account for hydrostatic head, which is not specified in the input files.
The \cobra{} input files for both problems can be found in \app{app:input_decks}.

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{subsect:experiments_procedure}
The two problems were set up such that the maximum allowable time-step was varied.
Each problem was run with the following maximum allowable time-steps: 1 [s], 0.1 [s], 0.01 [s], 0.001 [s], 0.0001 [s], and 0.00001 [s]. 
For the legacy runs, the scaled residuals were evaluated after a single newton-step.
For the nonlinear runs, the scaled nonlinear residuals were evaluated at the end of the newton-loop.
The nonlinear convergence criteria used for the nonlinear runs are described in \sect{sect:nl_cobra}.
The temporal convergence metric was evaluated during post-processing.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsect:results}

In total, there were twenty-four simulations run.
The two different problems were each run at six different maximum time-step sizes on each of the two version of \cobra.
Of the twenty-four simulations run, the legacy mode simulation of flashing at a time-step size of 1 [s] failed to run to completion.

\label{sect:result_time_step}

\comment{Does the nonlinear convergence impact the time-step size sensitivity of the solution?}

\subsubsection{Temporal Convergence Criteria}
\label{sect:result_temporal_convergence}

\comment{Does the temporal convergence metric provide a quantifiable measure of time-step size insensitivity?}

The metrics of interest that will be used to determine the convergence of the solution are the blah and blah.
For each of the test cases, these variables were compared at different time-steps.
First, it should be noted that the 1 [s] max time-step simulation of the flashing problem failed to run.
Why did it fail to run?
It could not reduce the time-step size enough to prevent too large of changes to the independent parameters.
There is a section earlier that talks about this issue.
The nonlinear cobra did run.
The same limits on change of variables is placed on both version of the software.
Why did the single-shot linearization fail to run?
I couldn't say mathematically.

It should be noted that the nonlinear \cobra produced a solution that was qualitatively different than semi-implicit.
This difference did not disappear as the time-step size was reduced.
The temporal convergence metric says that even for small time-step sizes, the solution is still not good.
This will be shown by a picture of the flashing solutions.
This will be backed up by pictures of the flashing residual.

The single-phase case ran just fine for both problems.

Moving on to the case of 0.1 [s].
In this simulation, both the

To examine efficacy of the the temporal convergence criteria, both the average and moment based temporal convergence criteria were evaluated for each of the twenty-three successful simulations.
See \tab{tab:criteria_ave} and \tab{tab:criteria_moment} for the data.

This is expected.
Other scientitist have noted this behavior.

\subsubsection{Lack of Nonlinearities}
\label{sect:result_linear_problem}

\comment{Does the single-shot linearization have temporal convergence properties similar to the nonlinear solver in the absence of "strong" nonlinearities?}

This section should show that the single-phase problem had a time-step insensitive solution.
It should also show that the solution for both the single-shot and the nonlinear versions of \cobra produced the same result.
The nonlinear \cobra did not produce the same results.
This is where I show the blowup picture of the oscilatory solution.
I also show how the residual increases as the time-step size is decreased.
It produced solutions with bounded oscillations at smaller time-step sizes.
In addition the residuals appear to be growing with smaller time-steps.
I do not know why at the moment.
This piss-poor behavior could be the result of multiple issues.
One possibility is the inconsistency between the scaled update vector used in the line-search algorithm and  the one used in the Newton loop convergence criteria.
Another possibility is the limiters used in the operator-based scaling were chosen poorly.

\section{Review}
\label{sect:review}

In review, the single-shot semi-implicit \cobra software was converted to a nonlinearly convergent semi-implicit algorithm.
A operator-based scaling was introduced and implemented in nonlinear \cobra.
Several defficiencies have been identified with the current implementation of the scaling.
A temporal-convergence criteria was developed and implemented to test for non-convergence of simulations.

Obviously in some serious need of work.
I should talk about the findings of the work.}
