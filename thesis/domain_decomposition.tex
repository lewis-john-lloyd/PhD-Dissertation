\chapter{Domain Decomposition}
\label{chap:domain_decomposition}
The domain decomposition algorithm is detailed below.

\section{Mathematical Formulation}
\label{sec:dd:math}
The mathematical formulation of the domain decompsition algorithm is worked out in the following pages.

Here be massive amounts of math.

\section{Algorithm in \cobra{}}
\label{sec:dd:algo}

The algorithmic implementation of the domain decomposition algorithm is now detailed.

\section{Verification Problems}
\label{sec:dd:verify}
To test the implementation of the domain decomposition algorithm, several problems of increasing complexity were developed.
The problems were developed so that the domain boundary fluxes would be as general as possible.
There are two primary problems, the up-down-up problem and the ge mixing 1b (<- What is that?) problem.

The problem has six sections.
Each section is 12 inches tall.
