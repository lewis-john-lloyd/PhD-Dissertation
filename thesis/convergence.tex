To evaluate the interplay between temporal convergence and nonlinear convergence, the following test procedure was proposed and executed.

\section{Procedure}
Three test problems were examined to determine the effect of temporal refinement on nonlinear convergence.
In each of the examples, an initial simulation is run subject to the time-step selection algorithm in COBRA, see \sect{sect:time_step_selection}.
After the initial simulation is completed, the simulation is run again with a maximum time-step size set to one-half of the smallest time-step size of the previous run.
This procedure is iterated until the maximum time-step size reaches 1.0E-6.
This cut-off was chosen for practical constraints.
