\label{sect:future_nonlinear_solver}

Given the results from \chap{chap:scaling_and_convergence}, the next step will be to implement the aforementioned internal coupling to COBRA-IE.
Upon completion of the implementation, a rigourous testing of the coupling will be completed.
After the infrastructure is in place, the selective nonlinear refinement will be implemented.
At that point, the experiments defined in \chap{chap:scaling_and_convergence} will be run again with the domain decomposition selectively hard coded to the region of the problems identified as having a large nonlinear residual.
Along the way possible metrics for automated detection and refinement may be investigated as time allows.
Another possible use of this methodology will be the adaptation of a fully implicit solution scheme in the selected subdomain.
This would provide a way to selectively remove courant limitations from the problem.
