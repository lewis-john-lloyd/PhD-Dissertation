\chapter{Work Proposal}
\label{chap:proposal}
To evaluate the proposed method, several objectives will be pursued.
The coding of the operator based scaling for the nonlinear residuals will be examined and modified as necessary to address the noted convergence issues.
An appropriate scaling of the Newton updates for convergence testing both within the linesearch algorithm and in the Newton loop will be determined.
The domain decomposition algorithm will be mathematically developed, coded, and evaluated.
Once the preceding three objectives have been met, a test problem will be developed to test the nonlinear refinement code as applied to a predetermined subdomain.
After the algorithmic framework has been evaluated, several geometrically complex problems with high local-nonlinearities will be developed to obtain temporal-convergence benchmarks of the legacy algorithm.
The same problems will then be evaluated using the proposed algorithm to determine the efficacy of temporal-convergence criteria.
Upon completion of the temporal-convergence tests, run time tests will be conducted to determine any performance gains or losses as a result of the proposed method.
Parametric studies will then be conducted to determine the impact of nonlinear convergence tolerances, phase appearance and disappearance thresholds, geometric residual imbalances, and residual thresholds for activation of nonlinear refinements.

\section{Scaling Evaluation}
\label{sect:proposal_scaling}
The current implementation of the operator-based scaling method outlined in \sect{sect:operator_scaling} has several issues that need to be addressed.
\comment{Here is where I will address the issues from the prelim work section.}

Another scaling question that needs to be addressed is the proper scaling for the Newton update.
\comment{More details required.}

Additionally, the interplay between the globalization termination criteria and the update scaling should be investigated. 
\comment{More details required.}

\section{Domain Decomposition}
\label{sect:domain_coupling}
The first step will be to implement a variation of the semi-implicit domain coupling algorithm presented in \sect{sect:code_coupling}.
The details of the derivation will need to be reworked to account for the different flow variables.
Upon completion of the implementation, a rigorous testing of the coupling method will be conducted.
This testing will be similar to that conducted by \citet{Weaver2002}.
Details of a testing plan should be discussed.
To evaluate the domain decomposition capabilities, a test problem will need to be developed.
This problem should have a singular characteristic: multiple geometric components.
The problem will be a single-phase run.
The test problem will be run in legacy mode to obtain a standard solution.
\comment{More details.}


\section{Temporal-Convergence Testing and Bench-marking}
\label{sect:proposal_temporal_testing}
Several problems with highly nonlinear physics should be constructed to test the temporal convergence criteria.
Legacy temporal convergence studies should be compared to nonlinear-spatial refinement results.

\section{Performance Evaluation}
\label{sect:proposal_performance_evaluation}
Theoretical operation counts should be calculated for legacy mode and nonlinear mode.
Run time calculations for various problems should be calculated.

\section{Parametric Studies}
\label{sect:proposal_parametric_studies}
Convergence criteria, max iteration count, and globalization parameters should be varied for a set number of problems to determine performance.

\section{Time Line}
\label{sect:proposal_time_line}
The proposed work will be done in blocks.
Where possible, objectives will be pursued in parallel.
Initial work will be to implement the software changes necessary to address issues with the current scaling implementation and add internal calculation of the temporal convergence criteria.
Parallel to those tasks, the mathematical formulation of the domain decomposition will be developed.
After the analytic framework for the domain decomposition has been developed, work on software changes necessary to isolate spatial components will begin.
During that time, testing of the temporal convergence criteria and the scaling factor will be completed.
Upon completion of the domain decomposition programming, testing of the domain decomposition algorithm will begin.
The final performance testing and parametric studies will be carried out in parallel.
\tab{tab:time_line} contains a proposed time line for this work.
