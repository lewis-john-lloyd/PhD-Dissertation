\chapter{Work Proposal}
\label{chap:proposal}
To evaluate the proposed methodology, several objectives will be pursued.
The coding of the physics based scaling for the nonlinear residual will be examined and modified as necessary to address the convergence issues such as false non-convergence.
An appropriate scaling of the Newton updates for convergence testing both within the linesearch algorithm and in the Newton loop will be determined.
The domain decomposition algorithm will be mathematically developed, coded, and evaluated.
Once the preceding three objectives have been met, a test problem will be developed to test the nonlinear refinement code as applied to a predetermined subdomain.
After the algorithmic framework has been evaluated, several geometrically complex problems with high local-nonlinearities will be developed to obtain temporal-convergence benchmarks of the legacy methodology.
The same problems will then be evaluated using the proposed algorithm to determine the efficacy of temporal-convergence criteria.
Upon completion of the temporal-convergence tests, run time tests will be conducted to determine any performance gains or losses as a result of the proposed methodology.
Parametric studies will then be conducted to determine the impact of nonlinear convergence tolerances, geometric residual imbalances, and residual thresholds for activation of nonlinear refinements.

\section{Domain Decomposition}
\label{sect:domain_coupling}
The first step will be to implement a variation of the semi-implicit domain coupling algorithm presented in \sect{sect:code_coupling}.
The details of the derivation will need to be reworked to account for the different flow variables.

Upon completion of the implementation, a rigorous testing of the coupling methodology will be conducted.
This testing will be similar to that conducted by \citet{Weaver2002}.

\subsection{Testing}
\label{subsect:domain_testing}
To evaluate the domain decomposition capabilitites, a geometric test problem will need to be developed.
This problem should have a singular characteristic: multiple geometric components.
The problem will be a single phase run
The test problem will be run in legacy mode to obtain a standard solution.
