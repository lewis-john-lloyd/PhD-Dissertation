\section{Intra-code Coupling}
\label{sect:future_intracode_coupling}

Given the results from \chap{chap:scaling_and_convergence}, the next step will be to implement an algorithm similar to the one discussed in \sect{sect:code_coupling}.
The details of the derivation will need to be reworked to account for the different flow variables.

Upon completion of the implementation, a rigorous testing of the coupling methodology will be conducted.
This testing will be similar to that conducted by \citet{Weaver2002}.

\subsection{Testing}
A simple test problem will be constructed to test the geometric coupling implementation.


\section{Improve Nonlinear Solver Efficiency}
\label{sect:future_nonlinear_solver}
After the infrastructure is in place, the selective nonlinear refinement will be implemented.
