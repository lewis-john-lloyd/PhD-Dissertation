\chapter{Numerical Results}
\label{chap:results}

There were a total of six test problems developed for this work.
Two of these problems evaluated the implementation and the efficacy of the nonlinear solver.
A third problem with extensive geometric complexity was designed to evaluate the implementation of the domain decomposition algorithm.
The fourth problem demonstrated that the selective nonlinear refinement can produce the nonlinear solver's solution with less computational effort.
The fifth problem showed the impact of spatially isolable nonlinearities upon solution in the remainder of the problem domain.
And, the last problem simulated a physically relevant situation to reactor safety.
This problem showed that use of the domain decomposition algorithm can obtain results that are more reflective of the nonlinear solver, with less computational time.
The goal of the tests, the methods used, and the models will be discussed in each section.

\section{Single-Phase Flow and Flashing Problems}
\label{sect:single_phase_and_flashing}

The two problems in this section were developed to evaluate the implementation and the efficacy of the nonlinear solver.
The first problem discussed demonstrated that the nonlinear solver reproduces the linear solution in the absence of strong nonlinearities.
The second problem illustrated that the use of the nonlinear solver on a problem with strong nonlinearities produces a solution that is more temporally consistent than that produced with the linear solver.
Additionally, this second problem demonstrated that temporal convergence using the linear solver may be misleading.

\subsection{Model}
\label{subsect:single_model}
The two models developed for these tests were thought problems with generic input conditions.
For both of these problems, the same computational geometry was used;  \fig{fig:exp_geometry} represents the model geometry.
Each block represents a single continuity volume with a fixed \dx{} of 4 [in].
Each continuity cell has a cross-sectional area of 4 [in$^2$].
The red block at the top of the subchannel represents a boundary cell where the pressure and enthalpy are specified.
It represents an infinite reservoir filled with a fluid at a specified thermodynamic state.
The red triangle represents a specified flow at the bottom edge of the first continuity volume. 

\begin{figure}[h!tb]

\caption{Geometry for single-phase and flashing problems.}
\label{fig:exp_geometry}
\end{figure}

The two problems, while having the same geometry, are different in their dominant physics.
One problem was designed to simulate single-phase, single-field continuous liquid flow in a pipe.
This problem will be referred to as the single-phase problem.
The second problem was designed such that high-pressure liquid flashes into steam as it enters a pipe initially filled with saturated vapor at a much lower pressure, known hereafter as the flashing problem.

\tab{tab:dualInitialConditions} provides the initial conditions for the two problems.
The pressure, enthalpy, and volume-fractions for the different fields allow for a complete description of the continuity variables.
The initial velocities for both problems are set to zero.

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/dualInitialConditionsTable}
\caption{Initial conditions for the single-phase and flashing problems.}
\label{tab:dualInitialConditions}
\end{table}

Each of the problems has a specified pressure-enthalpy boundary condition at the outlet and a flow-enthalpy boundary condition at the inlet of the domain.
\tab{tab:dualOutlet} contains the pressure, enthalpy, and composition of the pressure-enthalpy reservoir. 

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/dualOutletTable}
\caption{The outlet boundary conditions for the single-phase and flashing problems.}
\label{tab:dualOutlet}
\end{table}

The flow-enthalpy boundary condition describes the thermodynamic state of the in-flowing fluid and its flow rate.
\tab{tab:dualInlet} describes the inlet boundary conditions for the two problems.
The thermodynamic state of the inlet liquid for the flashing problem is unstable.
There is a 87.1 $\displaystyle \frac{\text{BTU}}{\lbm{}}]$ difference between the inlet enthalpy and the saturation enthalpy at 200 [psia].
This difference is what drive the liquid to flash into vapor.

\input{tables/dualInletTable}
\caption{The flow-enthalpy boundary conditions for the single-phase and flashing problems.}
\label{tab:dualInlet}
\end{table}

The specified mass flow, $\dot{m}(t)$, at the bottom of the subchannels is the same for both problems. 
This time-dependent function is given by \eqref{eqn:bc_time_func_single}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:bc_time_func_single}
\dot{m}(t) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cclrcll}
 0.0           & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , &                & t & \leq 1 & [\text{s}] \\
 0.5 ( t - 1)  & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , & 1\; [\text{s}] < & t & \leq 2 & [\text{s}] \\
 0.5           & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , &                & t & > 2    & [\text{s}]
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

Both problems adjust their initial pressure distribution to account for hydrostatic head.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsect:single_results}

The two models described above were subjected to to timestep-sensitivity studies.
An automated procedure was used to conduct the timestep sensitivity study.
Given an initial \dtmax{}, $\dt{}_{0}$, a refinement factor, $r_{f}$, and the number of timestep size refinements to be taken, $n_{t}$, the simulation was run with both the linear solver and the nonlinear solver for each \dtmax{} in the set, calculated according to \eqref{eqn:timeStepAlgo}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:timeStepAlgo}
\dtmax{} \in \bigcup^{n_{t}-1}_{i\, = 0} \frac{\dt{}_{0}}{r^{i}_{f}}
\end{equation}

For these two problems, the three parameters, $\dt{}_{0}$, $r_{f}$, and $n_{t}$, were 1.0, 10.0, and 6, respectively.
Each of the two problems were run with both the linear and the nonlinear solver at each of the six different \dtmax{}; in total there were 24 simulations run.
The nonlinear convergence criteria used for the nonlinear simulations were $\kmax$ = 35, $F_{\text{tol}}$ = \expneg{1.0}{6}, and $\delta_{\text{tol}}$ = \expneg{1.0}{8}.

The results from the simulations will now be analyzed to determine the impact of nonlinear convergence upon time-step size sensitivity.
The solutions produced by both solvers will be compared to determine the efficacy of the convergence metric in determining the validity of the nonlinear solution.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]

\end{figure}

\input{plots/single1pt000em5}
\caption{Single-phase solution with \dtmax{} = 5.0 {[s]}.}
\label{fig:single1pt000em5}
\end{figure}

The single-phase case was designed to test if the linear solver produced a simulation result that was equivalent to that produced by the nonlinear solver.
More specifically, it was designed to show that for problems where the physics of interest have relatively low nonlinearities, the linear solver provides as accurate a solution as the nonlinear solver.
\fig{fig:single1pt000em0} and \fig{fig:single1pt000em5} show the solution produced by both the nonlinear and linear solvers of \cobra{}.
The solutions produced by both solvers are qualitatively equivalent at \dtmax{} = 1.0 [s] and \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{5} [s].
This indicates that the linear solver is adequate in regions where the solution is not highly nonlinear.

For the flashing problem, the parameter of interest for temporal convergence testing is $\alpha_g$ at 2 [in] from the inlet of the pipe.
This parameter is chosen because it represents the region where the nonlinearities should have the largest impact on the solution as this is the location where the flashing occurs.
As such, this location will be sensitive to the rate of vapor formation from the thermodynamically unstable liquid that enters the cell.
\fig{fig:flashing1pt0000em0} shows the gaseous volume fraction 2 [in] from the inlet of the pipe as a function of time for a \dtmax{} of \expneg{1.0}{1} [s] for both the linear and the nonlinear solvers.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]

\input{plots/flashing1pt0000em0}
\caption{Flashing solution at \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{1} {[s]}.}

\end{figure}

\caption{Flashing solution at \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{5}{[s]}.}
\label{fig:flashing1pt0000em5}
\end{figure}

Note that the nonlinearly resolved solution is qualitatively different than the linear single-shot solution, \fig{fig:flashing1pt0000em0}.
Even as the \dtmax{} is reduced, this discrepancy does not disappear, \fig{fig:flashing1pt0000em5}.
The two solutions do not converge to the same solution as the timestep size is reduced.
However, the solution to the flashing problem produced by the nonlinear solver, \fig{fig:flashingAlphaNln}, qualitatively varies less as the \dtmax{} is reduced than that produced by the linear solver, \fig{fig:flashingAlphaLin}.
However, both \fig{fig:flashingAlphaLin} and \fig{fig:flashingAlphaNln} show that as the timestep size is reduced the two different solutions become more timestep-size insensitive.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/flashingAlphaNln}
\caption{Nonlinear solver flashing solutions.}
\label{fig:flashingAlphaNln}
\end{figure}

The two solvers, when applied to the same problem that contains highly nonlinear physics, produce two different timestep-size invariant solutions.
These two solutions achieve qualitative timestep-size invariance at different timestep sizes.
The parameter of interest in the solution produced by the nonlinear solver with a 1 [s] \dtmax{} is qualitatively close to that produced with a 0.1 [s] \dtmax{}, \fig{fig:flashingDtInsensitiveNln}.
The same level of qualitative timestep-size invariance is achieved in the linear solver solutions between a \dtmax{} of \expneg{1.0}{3} [s] and \expneg{1.0}{4} [s], \fig{fig:flashingDtInsensitiveLin}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/flashingDtInsensitiveNln}

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/flashingDtInsensitiveLin}
\caption{Linear solver timestep-size insensitive flashing solution.}
\label{fig:flashingDtInsensitiveLin}
\end{figure}

The timestep-size insensitive solution produced by the nonlinear solver occurs at a maximum timestep size three orders of magnitude greater than that achieved by the linear solver in \cobra{}.
An examination of the nonlinear residual over the course of the transient provides insight into why this behavior is observed.
For the linear runs, the scaled residuals were evaluated after the single Newton step, $\tilde{\vec{F}}^{1}$.
For the nonlinear runs, the scaled nonlinear residuals were evaluated at the end of the Newton-loop, $\tilde{\vec{F}}^{k}$.
The scaled residual after the single Newton step of the linear solver for flashing problem indicates that, even for small timestep sizes, the solution obtained still does not satisfy the discrete nonlinear equations, \fig{fig:flashingResidualLin}.
This is in contrast to the nonlinear flashing problem, which shows a lower residual over the course of the simulation, \fig{fig:flashingResidualNln}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/flashingResidualLin}
\caption{Residual of the flashing solution for the linear solver.}

\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/flashingResidualNln}
\caption{Residual of the flashing solution for the nonlinear solver.}
\label{fig:flashingResidualNln}
\end{figure}

The reduction in the residual produced by the linear solver, \fig{fig:flashingResidualLin}, shows that the reduction of the maximum allowable timestep size now serves two purposes.
The first is that as \dtmax{} is reduced the nonlinear physics are being better resolved; however, even for small \dtmax{}, the residuals are still large compared to those of the nonlinear solution, \fig{fig:flashingResidualNln}.
The second purpose in reducing \dtmax{} is to decrease the error due to the discrete approximation of the temporal integral of the governing equations.
While the reduction of the maximum timestep size in the linear solver serves the purpose of reducing the residual, the nonlinear solver performs this task naturally.
Therefore, in the nonlinear solver the reduction of the maximum timestep size primarily serves to reduce the error from the approximate discrete temporal integral.

One way to quantify the difference between the solutions is by measuring the residual convergence metrics outlined in \sect{sect:temporal_convergence}.
These metrics provide a measure of how poorly the discrete nonlinear equations are being solved at every timestep in the transient.
The resolution of the residual allows for a solution that is less sensitive to timestep size selection than for a solution that does not resolve the residual.
The convergence metrics will be used to determine if a qualitative temporal-convergence determination can lead to the acceptance of a solution that is not nonlinearly converged.

For each of the test cases, the two different metrics were compared at the different \dtmax{}.
These convergence metrics were evaluated during post-processing.
To examine efficacy of the the temporal convergence criteria, both the average and moment-based temporal convergence criteria were evaluated for each of the 24 simulations.
The values of these metrics will be compared between different solvers for the same test problem. 
The two different nonlinear convergence metrics will now be examined for the flashing problem.
\tab{tab:flashingMetric} shows both the average metric, $\tilde{R}$, and the moment-based metric, $\tilde{R}_{\text{M}}$.
\tab{tab:singleMetric} shows the two metrics for the single-phase problem.

% Problem that shows that the domain decomposition algorithm is implemented correctly.
%============================================================================
\section{Complex Geometry Problem}
\label{sect:complexProblem}
The complex geometry problem tests whether the domain decomposition algorithm was implemented properly.
To properly test the domain decomposition algorithm many different permutations of the composition of the nonlinear domain are required.
The presence of both axial momentum flow paths and transverse momentum flow paths is necessary.
If the nonlinear domain of the decomposed problem is subjected to just a single Newton step, then the resulting dual domain solution should match within numerical round off that of a single domain with a single Newton step regardless of the composition of the nonlinear domain.
A model of the General Electric nine-rod subchannel experimental facility \cite{Lahey1970} suits the requirements of this test.

\subsection{Model}
\label{sect:complexModel}

The General Electric (GE) experiments were conducted in an experimental facility with a nine-rod bundle representative of a BWR subchannel.
The exact geometry of the experimental facilities can be found in the GE technical report \cite{Lahey1970}.
The basic layout of the portion of the facility that is of interest to this work is as follows: there is an inlet plenum that is opens into a nine-rod bundle depicted in \fig{fig:channel_layout}; above the rod-bundle there is an outlet plenum.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{images/position_of_pressure_taps}
\caption{Cross-section of rod bundle geometry adapted from GE experiment \cite{Lahey1970}.}
\label{fig:channel_layout}
\end{figure}

The \cobra{} model is broken into three sections.
The first section is the inlet plenum, while the third section is the outlet plenum.
The inlet plenum is 12 [in] tall with a cross-sectional area of 2.93 $[ \text{in}^2]$.
The outlet plenum is identically dimensioned.
The second section represents the rod-bundle.
This section is 121.5 [in] tall.
The rod-bundle is approximated by a four-by-four grid of sixteen subchannels.
There are the four corner subchannels, the eight side subchannels, and the four center subchannels in the model.
The dimensions for the various subchannels are shown in \fig{fig:channel_layout}.

The primary purpose of this problem is to test the ability of the domain decomposition algorithm to accurately recover the linear solution when the nonlinear domain is restricted to a single Newton step.
For that reason the details of the boundary and initial conditions are omitted here.

There are eighteen subchannels in this model: the 16 subchannels in the rod bundle, the inlet plenum, and the outlet plenum.
That means that there are $2^{18}$ possible ways to decompose this problem with the domain decomposition algorithm.
The time required to run all possible permutations is prohibitive, so only a subset are simulated here.
To test if the domain decomposition algorithm was implemented correctly, 256 different permutations were selected at random and run.

\subsection{Results}
\label{sect:complexResults}

The intent of this problem is to determine if the domain decomposition algorithm is properly implemented.
First, recognize that the use of the domain decomposition algorithm with only a single Newton step permitted in the nonlinear domain results a single Newton step being taken over the entire domain.
This provided the basis for the following comparison.
Regardless of how the $2^{18}$ subchannels of the problem are allocated between a linear and nonlinear domain, the solutions produced by the domain decomposition algorithm should be within round-off error to that produced by the single domain linear solver.
The caveat is that the different linear algebra involved with the domain decomposition will not produce the same floating-point solution as that produced by the linear solver.
This floating-point variance should not impact the solution above the level of numerical round-off error.
However, the traditional \cobra{} graphics file is created with single precision variables.
These single precision variables were incapable of capturing the error present in the simulation since, to single precision, the results were always the same between the domain decomposed and the non-decomposed solutions.
A special version of \cobra{} was compiled that produced the variables of interest in double precision.

There were 256 different simulations run: one where the entire domain is linear, one where the entire domain is nonlinear solver, and 254 where a random number of random subchannels are nonlinear.
This collection is a representative subset of the $2^{18}$ possible decompositions.
For each of these simulations, the pressure at two locations were recorded: the pressures near the top and near the bottom of the upper left corner subchannel of \fig{fig:channel_layout} were chosen.
The differences at each in point in between these pressures and those produced by the linear solver were summed over the course of the transient.
The bar graph in \fig{fig:complexBar} shows the distribution of these error integrals at both the top and bottom of the subchannel.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/complexBar}
\caption{Histogram of pressure error at two locations.}
\label{fig:complexBar}
\end{figure}

These results indicate that the domain decomposition algorithm was implemented as intended.

% Problem that shows that when it is possible to isolate the nonlinearities, the computational cost can be lower.
%============================================================================
\section{Valve-Type Problem}
\label{sect:valveProblem}

This problem is designed to demonstrate the ability of the domain decomposition algorithm to resolve isolated nonlinearities at a lower computational cost than the fully nonlinear solver. 
First, the model will be discussed and initial and boundary conditions provided.
Second, the timestep sensitivity study of the solution for both the linear and the nonlinear solver will be detailed.
Next, the portion of the domain with the nonlinearities will be isolated via the domain decomposition algorithm and another timestep sensitivity study will be conducted.
Finally, the solution and run time data from the three methods will be compared.

\subsection{Model}
\label{subsect:valveModel}

The system being modeled is that of four pipes.
Each pipe is modeled as having ten continuity volumes, each with a height, $\dx{}$, of 4 [in] and a cross-sectional area, $ A_{c} $, of 16 $[\text{in}^{2}]$.
Two pipes have a fixed obstruction, manifesting as a loss coefficients, along their lengths.
One pipe has a complete obstruction, preventing flow.
The last pipe has a boundary condition that imitates the behavior of a valve by using a time dependent loss coefficient.
Initially fully open, the valve slowly closes.
While closing, the valve stops twice at cross-sectional areas that are equivalent to the two loss coefficients of the two partially obstructed pipes.
After fully closing, the valve returns to its first stopping point.

The pipes are initially full of subcooled liquid at 800 $[ \text{psia}] $.
The bottom and top of the pipes are open to reservoirs.
The bottom reservoir is full of subcooled liquid with a time variant pressure.
The pressure starts at at 802 $[ \text{psia} ] $ and increases to 818 $[ \text{psia}]$ over the first second, staying there for the duration of the problem.
The top reservoir is full of subcooled liquid at 800 $[\text{psia} ] $.
This pressure does not change as a function of time.
The pressure difference that exists between these two reservoirs is what drives the flow in this problem.

The model used in \cobra{} is a single section.
Within that section there are four subchannels.
These subchannels are hydrodynamically isolated from each other.
They correspond to the four pipes.
The two partially-obstructed pipes have user-defined loss coefficients placed at an elevation of 15 [in].
The two coefficients are 40 $[-]$ and 160 $[-]$.
The fully-obstructed subchannel has a no-flow boundary condition at 15 [in].
The fourth subchannel has a time dependent area ratio multiplier, $A(t)_r$, at 15 [in].
This multiplier acts to reduce the area of the momentum flow path, $A_m$, used in the determination of form losses and wall drag.
However, these four subchannels have had their wall drag terms artificially reduced.
Reducing the wall drag allows the impact of the loss coefficients upon the solution to be isolated.
Since there is no wall drag in this problem, the area ratio can be related to the effective loss coefficient, $K(t)$, by \eqref{eqn:valveLossCoefficient}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:valveLossCoefficient}
K(t) = \frac{K_{o}}{{A(t)_r}^2}
\end{equation}

The base loss coefficient, $K_o$, for subchannel four is 10 [-].
Using \eqref{eqn:valveLossCoefficient}, the equivalent area ratios for the loss coefficients of the two partially obstructed pipes, 40 [-] and 160 [-], are 0.5 and 0.25 respectively.
The time dependent area ratio multiplier for subchannel four is shown in \fig{fig:valveTransientArea}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/valveTransientArea}
\caption{Transient area ratio for vale-type problem.}
\label{fig:valveTransientArea}
\end{figure}

The simulation is run to an end time of 19 seconds.
The functional form of the transient area boundary condition was chosen so that the solution of the transient area pipe would mimic each of the three other pipes for portions of the transient.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsect:valveResults}

The parameter of interest is the flow of liquid at the 15 [in] above the inlet.
This location corresponds to the location of either the loss coefficients, the no-flow boundary condition, or the variable momentum-area boundary condition in each of the respective pipes.
For this study, $\dt{}_{0}$, $r_{f}$, and $n_{t}$ used in \eqref{eqn:timeStepAlgo} were 1.0, 2.0, and 10, respectively.
Upon examining the solution, it was determined that timestep size was \dtcrnt{} limited for a portion of the transient until \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.56}{2}{[s]} was reached.
The timestep history of the simulations from \dtmax{} = 1.0 through \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]} were identical for both the linear and the nonlinear solution.
As such, the first four simulation results for each solver were dropped from the data sets since they represented duplicate results.
The solution obtained with \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]} with the linear solver is shown in \fig{fig:valveLin6pt25em02}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/valveLin6pt2500em02}
\caption{Valve problem with \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]} with the linear solver.}
\label{fig:valveLin6pt25em02}
\end{figure}

This solution shows that the there is a non-physical spike in the mass flow rate when the closed valve starts to open at 15 [s].
This behavior is observed for the linear solver's solutions at successively smaller max timesteps through the smallest \dtmax{}, \expneg{1.95}{3}{[s]}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/valveLinSols}
\label{fig:valveLinSols}
\caption{Zoom of flow rate in linear solutions to the valve problem.}
\end{figure}

The presence of the non-physical behavior in the flow rate in the simulation with \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.56}{2}{[s]}, a \dtmax{} that produces a \dt{} history that is never \dtcrnt{} limited, necessitated that additional timestep refinements be examined for a smooth solution.
Subsequent timestep refinements produced results where the flow-rate spikes became progressively smaller; however, the time-step refinement study did not yield a solution that was free of this perturbation, as shown in \fig{fig:valveLinSols}.
The lack of a linear solution that is free from this perturbation is not an impediment to this study since the purpose is not to find a \dtmax{} that produces such a solution.
Instead, \tab{tab:valveLinTable} shows the run time statistics for the linear solver's solutions.

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/valveLinTable}
\caption{Run time data for the valve problem using the linear solver.}
\label{tab:valveLinTable}
\end{table}

In \tab{tab:valveLinTable} the first column shows the maximum timestep size for the simulation.
The second column shows the number of successful timesteps taken, $N_{t}$.
The third column is the CPU time required to complete simulation, $T_{\text{CPU}}$.
The final column is the the CPU time per timestep for a given simulation.
On average, the CPU time per timestep is \expneg{2.8}{3}{[s]} for the linear solution.

Next, the nonlinear solver was used to perform the same timestep sensitivity study.
The same set of \dtmax{} were run.
The solution at \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]} is shown in \fig{fig:valveNln6pt25em02}

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/valveNln6pt2500em02}
\caption{Valve problem with \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]} with the nonlinear solver.}
\label{fig:valveNln6pt25em02}
\end{figure}

The solution obtained at \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]} does not exhibit the nonphysical spike in the flow rate that the linear solution displays.
This solution is also obtained at the largest \dt{} run in the study, \expneg{1.0}{0}{[s]}.
Reducing the \dtmax{} produces solutions that are qualitatively identical to that shown above.
\fig{fig:valveNlnSols} shows the same zoomed view of at 15 [s], when the valve opens.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/valveNlnSols}
\caption{Zoom of flow rate in nonlinear solutions to the valve problem.}
\label{fig:valveNlnSols}
\end{figure}

These results indicate that the linear solver's timestep refinement serves the purpose of trying to resolve an isolated linearization error in a single subchannel of the problem.
By using the nonlinear solver, that error is removed and subsequent timestep reductions are not necessary to obtain the physical solution.
However, \tab{tab:valveNlnTable} shows that the nonlinear solver takes more CPU time per timestep than the linear solver.

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/valveNlnTable}
\caption{Run time data for the valve problem using the nonlinear solver.}
\label{tab:valveNlnTable}
\end{table}

Given that the nonlinearities in this problem are clearly isolated in a single subchannel, using the domain decomposition algorithm provides an ideal test to determine if a nonlinearly converged solution can be obtained at a lower computational cost than the full nonlinear solver.
The use of the domain decomposition algorithm in this problem is restricted to the subchannel with the valve.
The other three subchannels are not included in the nonlinear domain.
The same set of timesteps is run to collect data.
\fig{fig:valveDom6pt25em02} shows the solution as obtained with \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]}; the results in this figure are qualitatively indistinguishable from the results of the nonlinear solver.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/valveDom6pt2500em02}
\caption{Valve problem with \dtmax{} = \expneg{6.25}{2}{[s]} and domain decomposition active.}
\label{fig:valveDom6pt25em02}
\end{figure}

The results for subsequently smaller timesteps are indistinguishable from those presented in \fig{fig:valveNlnSols}.
This result indicates that the nonlinear solution can be obtained with the domain decomposition algorithm.
Since the nonlinearities were designed to be isolated, this result is expected.
However, looking at the run time statistics, \tab{tab:valveDomTable}, provides additional information about the domain decomposition algorithm's performance.

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/valveDomTable}
\caption{Run time data for the valve problem using domain decomposition.}
\label{tab:valveDomTable}
\end{table}

The CPU time per time step of the domain decomposition is lower than that obtained by the nonlinear solver.
\fig{fig:valveRunTime} shows that the domain decomposition algorithm is capable of producing the same solution as the the nonlinear solver at less than half the cost per timestep than the nonlinear solver.

\end{figure}

As the \dtmax{} is reduced, the cost of the nonlinear solver decreases because there are fewer nonlinear iterates required per timestep.
This reduction in the number of Newton iterates per timestep is also evident in the domain decomposition run-time plot.
This problem was developed to show that for a problem with isolable nonlinearities, the application of the domain decomposition algorithm to resolve those nonlinearities will result in a smaller computational cost than the global nonlinear solver while producing results that are qualitatively as accurate.

\section{Filling Pipe Problem}
\label{sect:vmp}
This problem was developed to illustrate that the use of the domain decomposition algorithm in the presence of localized nonlinearities produces a global solution that is in-line with the nonlinear solution.
The problem will be run with a large timestep to show how the solution from the linear and the nonlinear solvers differ.
The solution at smaller timesteps is shown to be in agreement with the analytic solution for both the linear and the nonlinear solver.
The solution produced by the domain decomposition algorithm is then shown as a function of timestep size.
Finally, the impact of resolving local nonlinearities on the global solution is discussed.

\subsection{Model}
\label{subsect:vmpModel}

A vertical pipe slowly filling with saturated water at atmospheric pressure is the basis for this simulation.
The physical pipe is 3 [ft] tall, having a 36 [in$^{2}$] cross-sectional area and a wetted perimeter of 24 [in].
The pipe is initially full of saturated steam at 14.7 [psia].
The top of the pipe is open to an infinite reservoir of saturated steam at 14.7 [psia].
Saturated water flows into the bottom of the pipe, displacing the steam.
The boundary and initial conditions are contained in \tab{tab:vmpBCIC}.

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/vmpBCICTable}
\caption{Initial and boundary conditions for the fill problem.}
\label{tab:vmpBCIC}
\end{table}

The pressure at a given point in the pipe has a simple, closed-form, analytic solution under the assumptions listed below.
The first assumption is that the variations in the liquid's specific volume, $v_{l}$, within the range of pressures experienced during the course of the simulation can be neglected.
The liquid flow rate into the problem is given by \eqref{eqn:vmpMassFlowRate}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vmpMassFlowRate}
\dot{m}_{l}(t) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cclrcll}
 \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}\cdot t & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , & 0\; [\text{s}] < & t & \leq 1 & [\text{s}] \\
 \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}        & [\frac{ \lbm{} }{\text{s}}] & , &                  & t & > 1    & [\text{s}]
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

The maximum flow rate, $\dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}$, is 0.406503 $ [ \frac{\lbm{}}{s} ]$.
The volumetric flow rate is given by \eqref{eqn:vmpVolumetricFlowRate}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vmpVolumetricFlowRate}
\dot{V}(t) = v_{l} \dot{m}_{l}(t)
\end{equation}

Since the pipe has a cross sectional area, $A_{c}$, the volumetric flow rate can be expressed as $\dot{V} = A_{c} \dot{h}(t)$, where $\dot{h}(t)$ is the rate of change in height as a function of time.
Integrating \eqref{eqn:vmpVolumetricFlowRate} produces the total volume of liquid in the pipe, $V(t)$, as a function of time, \eqref{eqn:vmpTotalLiquid}, which can represented as a function of height, $h(t)$.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vmpTotalLiquid}
A_{c} h(t) = 
 \left\{
\begin{array}{cclrcll}
v_{l} \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}\frac{t^{2}}{2} & [ \text{ft}^{3} ] & , & 0\; [\text{s}] < & t & \leq 1 & [\text{s}] \\
v_{l} \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}} \left( t - \onehalf  \right) & [ \text{ft}^{3} ] & , &                  & t & > 1    & [\text{s}]
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

Neglecting the hydrostatic head contribution from the vapor column, the pressure at any point and time in the problem, $P(t, h(t))$, is either 14.7 [psia], $P_o$, if the water level has yet to reach that point, or it is the hydrostatic pressure dictated by the height of the liquid column above that point, \eqref{eqn:vmpHydroStaticHead}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vmpHydroStaticHead}
P(t, h(t))= 
 \left\{
\begin{array}{cclrcll}
P_o & [ \text{psia} ] & , & 0\; [\text{s}] < & t & \leq t^{*}(h) & [\text{s}] \\
P_o + \frac{ h(t) - h }{ v_{l} } & [ \text{psia} ] & , &  & t & > t^{*}(h) & [\text{s}]
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

The function $t^{*}(h)$ in \eqref{eqn:vmpHydroStaticHead} is given by \eqref{eqn:vmpTimeStar} and represents the time it takes the water level to reach a given height.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vmpTimeStar}
t^{*}(h)= 
 \left\{
\begin{array}{cclrcll}
\sqrt{\frac{2 A_c h}{v_{l} \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}}} & [ \text{s} ] & , & 0\; [ \text{ft}] < & h & \leq \frac{v_l \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}}{2 A_c} & [\text{ft}] \\
\frac{ A_c h }{v_{l} \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}} + \onehalf & [ \text{s} ] & , &                & h & > \frac{v_l \dot{m}_{l,\text{max}}}{2 A_c} & [\text{ft}]
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation}

This analytic function for pressure evaluated at six different axial heights from 0.0 [s] to 75.0 [s] is shown in \fig{fig:vmpAnalyticSol}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/vmpAnalytic}
\caption{Analytic solution to the filling problem.}
\label{fig:vmpAnalyticSol}
\end{figure}

The \cobra{} model of this pipe is composed of two sections, each with a single subchannel.
While it is not necessary for so simple of a problem to have multiple sections, it was done to allow for the domain decomposition algorithm to run, since the algorithm uses subchannels to decompose the domain.
The subchannel in the bottom section is 1 [ft] tall and is broken into three continuity volumes, each 4 [in] high.
The top section's subchannel is 2 [ft] tall and is broken into six continuity volumes, each 4 [in] high.

First, the simulation was run with both the linear and the nonlinear solver.
The nonlinear convergence parameters were \kmax{} = 35, $F_{tol}$ = \expneg{1.0}{6}, $\delta_{tol}$ = \expneg{1.0}{8}. 
Each simulation was run for 75 $[ \text{s} ]$.
The largest permissible timestep size, \dtmax{}, was chosen as \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]}.
The \dtmax{} was reduced several times over two orders of magnitude to determine timestep sensitivity.

For each simulation, a time-averaged error measure was calculated.
The error at a given point was determined by taking the square root of the the integral of the squared difference between the analytic pressure, $P_{a}$, and that calculated by \cobra{}, $P_{c}$, divided by the total simulation run time, $T$.
This error at the center of the lower six continuity volumes was summed to produce a measure of the error in the calculated result, \eqref{eqn:vpmPressureError}.
The bottom six continuity volumes were selected since the simulation was run only until they were filled.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:vpmPressureError}
e_{p} =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}} \sum_{i\,=\,1}^{6}\sqrt{\int_{0}^{T} \left(P_{i,c}(t) - P_{i,a}(t)\right)^{2} \mathrm{d} t}
\end{equation}

Next, the domain decomposition algorithm was activated.
There were two simulations in this run: one was with the bottom subchannel in the nonlinear domain and the other with the top subchannel in the nonlinear domain.
The \dtmax{} for these runs was chosen to be \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]}.
The solution of these runs will be compared to the solutions produced by the single domain solvers.

\subsection{Results}
\label{subsect:vmpResults}

The simulation was first run with the linear solver.
The \dtmax{} was chosen to be \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]}.
The pressure at the center of the bottom six continuity volumes in the problem are shown in \fig{fig:linFill1em1}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/vmpLinear1em1}
\caption{Filling problem with \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]} with the linear solver.}
\label{fig:linFill1em1}
\end{figure}

The solution at this \dtmax{} is rather noisy and when the actual timestep sizes are examined, \dtmax{} is infrequently reached due to restrictive \dtcrnt{} limits.
The measure of error, $e_{p}$, for this simulation was \expneg{7.5}{2}{[psia]}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/vmpLinear5em2}
\caption{Filling problem with \dtmax{} = \expneg{5.0}{2}{[s]} using the linear solver.}
\label{fig:vmpLinFill5em2}
\end{figure}

The solution from the simulation with \dtmax{} = \expneg{5.0}{2}{[s]}, \fig{fig:vmpLinFill5em2}, is more in line with the analytic solution, \fig{fig:vmpAnalyticSol}.
The slight spike visible in \fig{fig:vmpLinFill5em2} are characteristic of \cobra{} software.
They cannot be removed by either resolution of nonlinearities or reduction in timestep size.
\tab{tab:vmpLinRunTime} shows the run time data for the linear cases that were run.

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/vmpLinRunTimeTable}
\caption{Linear solver's data for the fill problem.}
\label{tab:vmpLinRunTime}
\end{table}

With the nonlinear solver active, the same three timestep sizes were run.
The pressures from the \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]} case is shown in \fig{fig:nlnFill1em1}.
The measure of error, $e_{p}$, for this simulation was \expneg{3.5}{2}{[psia]}.
This error measure was half that of the linear case at the same \dtmax{}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/vmpNLN1em1}
\caption{Filling problem with \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]} with the nonlinear solver active.}
\label{fig:nlnFill1em1}
\end{figure}

The solution obtained by the nonlinear solver at this large \dtmax{} is comparable to those obtained by the smaller timestep sizes, \dtmax{} = \expneg{5.0}{2}{[s]} and \expneg{1.5}{3}{[s]}, with the linear solver.
Examining the actual timestep sizes shows that the nonlinear simulation with \dtmax{} = \expneg{5.0}{2}{[s]} actually run at \dtmax{} for the majority of timesteps.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/vmpDeltaTNln1em1}
\caption{Comparison of \dt{} to \dtcrnt{} for the nonlinear solver with \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]}.}
\label{fig:vmpDeltaTNln1em1}
\end{figure}

The nonlinear solver actually took fewer total timesteps than the linear solver in this simulation.
This was possible because the calculated \dtcrnt{} limit is different for the nonlinear case.
The larger \dtcrnt{} is possible because the nonphysical oscillations in the linear solution's pressures are no longer present.
These deviations had induced large velocities, which had reduced \dtcrnt{} below \dtmax{} causing \cobra{} to reduce the timestep size repeatedly.
The nonlinear solver produces qualitatively and quantitatively similar solutions at more restrictive \dtmax{}.
At the smaller \dtmax{} both the linear and the nonlinear solver's solutions had similar error measures, approximately \expneg{3.5}{2}{[psia]}.

Reducing the nonlinear error at each timestep allows \cobra{} to run at larger \dt{} without a reduction in the accuracy of the solution.
However, the use of the nonlinear solver imposes additional computational costs.
These costs are evident in \tab{tab:vmpNlnRunTime}.
The run time per timestep of the nonlinear solver for this problem is on average 5.5 times that of the linear solver.

\begin{table}[h!tb]
\centering
\singlespace
\input{tables/vmpNlnRunTimeTable}
\caption{Nonlinear solver's data for the fill problem.}
\label{tab:vmpNlnRunTime}
\end{table}

These results make a case that using the nonlinear solver at large timestep sizes can produce more accurate solutions that are comparable to those from the linear solver at smaller timesteps.
The application of the domain decomposition algorithm provides more insight into impact of unresolved local nonlinearities.
The domain decomposition simulations were run with \dtmax{} = \expneg{1.0}{1}{[s]}.
The first simulation to be examined will be the one with the bottom subchannel in the nonlinear domain, \fig{fig:vmpDDBotChan}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/vmpBotNLN1em1}
\caption{Filling problem with the bottom subchannel in the nonlinear domain.}
\label{fig:vmpDDBotChan}
\end{figure}

While the water front is in the nonlinear domain, the pressures everywhere are in alignment with the analytic solution.
However, once the water front enters the linear domain, the unresolved nonlinearities in the linear domain induce nonphysical pressure oscillations in both domains.
This result is mirrored in the case where the top subchannel is in the nonlinear domain, \fig{fig:vmpDDTopChan}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/vmpTopNLN1em1}
\caption{Filling problem with the top subchannel in the nonlinear domain.}
\label{fig:vmpDDTopChan}
\end{figure}

\fig{fig:vmpDDTopChan} shows that when the water level is in the bottom subchannel, the nonphysical solution propagates globally.
In addition, once the water level enters the nonlinear domain, the solution is out of sync with the analytic solution.
This discrepancy is due to the time lag introduced by the linear solver while the water level is in the linear domain.

This problem highlights the impact of unresolved nonlinearities on the global solution.
Isolating places where the nonlinearities are present and solving those regions with the nonlinear solver allows for a global solution that more accurately solves the nonlinear equations.

\section{Refill Problem}
\label{sect:refillProblem}

The final test problem is meant to reflect a scenario relevant to LWR safety.
The model is a simplified BWR core model with upper-head safety injection that is going through the refill phase of an accident scenario.
The intent of this refill problem is to bring together the individual assertions from the previous test problems.
In particular, if there are localized nonlinearities, then the use of the domain decomposition algorithm can produce results that are not only more accurate than those produced by the linear solver but are also less computationally expensive than those produced by the nonlinear solver.

\subsection{Model}
\label{sect:refillModel}

This problem is a model of a generic BWR nuclear reactor vessel.
\fig{fig:refillModel} contains a cross-sectional schematic of the discrete representation of this problem.
There are three sections in the problem.
In the first section there is the inlet plenum to the core and two hemispheres of the downcomer.
The downcomers are connected to each other and the inlet plenum, as indicated by dotted lines.
The second section contains a three-subchannel representation of the reactor core, a subchannel representing the water buffer at the outer edge of the core, and the two subchannel representation of the downcomer.
One of the core subchannels represents the inner ring of the core, denoted by point C.
Another subchannel represents the outer core ring, marked by point D.
And, a third represents the control rod subchannels.
This subchannel is straddling the two core rings.
Each of the core subchannels is hydrodynamically isolated from the other other core subchannels, indicated by the solid black lines.
There is no hydrodynamic communication between the core subchannels and the two downcomer subchannels, once again indicated by the solid black lines.
The third section represents the upper head of the reactor.
In this model, there are transverse flow paths between all adjacent subchannels in the upper head.
However, the transverse flow paths connecting the two water buffer subchannels to the two downcomer subchannels are modeled by a specialized set of PDEs meant to represent leakages paths.
These equations have are a simplified physical model and use a homogeneous-flow assumption.
The use of the leakage path models to represent the connections between the water buffer subchannels and the downcomer subchannels allows for a pressure differential to exist between the upper head of the core and the top of the downcomer.
In the third section there is also a safety injection inlet at point B, and a pressure connection to containment at point A.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{images/refillModel}
\caption{\cobra{} model for the refill problem.}
\label{fig:refillModel}
\end{figure}

The lower plenum and the bottom of the downcomer in section one are initially full of saturated water.
The downcomer in sections two and three, however, have a mixture of saturated steam and a \ncg{} mixture representing air.
The mole fraction of the \ncg{} in these four subchannel starts at 25\%.
The pressure boundary condition at point A is connected to an infinite reservoir of this \ncg{}-steam mixture at 45 [psia]. 
Both the four-subchannel core region in section two and the seven-subchannel upper head in section three are full of saturated steam.
Of note, this model does not have solid fuel structures to produce heat in the reactor core.
The fuel rods were omitted from this work because the evaluation of the impact of the nonlinear solver on wall heat is beyond the scope of this work.
However, to simulate the presence of these fuel rods, there are two source, points C \& D in \fig{fig:refillModel}, that produce steam within the two subchannels representing the core.
These sources are located near the top of section two.
The transient behavior of these sources is shown in \fig{fig:refillSteamRates}.
The steam generations rates were chosen such that the steam mass fluxes per subchannel were equal.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillSteamRates}
\caption{Refill problem steam generation rates.}
\label{fig:refillSteamRates}
\end{figure}

This steam rises into the upper head and condensation will be caused by the safety injection inlet flow.
This safety injection is saturated water at 45 [psia] and is initiated at 20 [s] into the transient.
Once initiated this safety injection will continue throughout the course of the transient.
\fig{fig:refillSafetyInjection} shows this time dependent behavior.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillSafetyInjection}
\caption{Refill problem safety injection rates.}
\label{fig:refillSafetyInjection}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Results}
\label{sect:refillResults}

Like previous problems, this simulation was subject to timestep sensitivity studies.
The set of timestep sizes analyzed is is given by \eqref{eqn:timeStepAlgo}.
For this problem, $\dt{}_{0}$, $r_{f}$, and ${n}$ were 0.02, 2.0, and 4 respectively.
Additionally, the nonlinear convergence parameters \kmax{}, $F_{tol}$, and $\delta_{tol}$ were 35, \expneg{1.0}{6}, and \expneg{1.0}{8}, respectively.

First, the macroscopic transient behavior of the simulation is as follows.
First, the safety injection nozzle starts to condense the steam present in the core, dropping the ambient pressure in the upper head.
This drop in pressure starts to draw a mixture of liquid, air, and steam into the core from the downcomer.
Once the steam generation is initiated, the pressure in the upper head increases, causing water the liquid water to pushed out the bottom of the core and back up into the downcomer.
There is some manometer type oscillations between the downcomer and the core as the downcomer fills with water.
The pressurization of the upper head from prevents the core filling in parallel with downcomer.
The downcomer will fill entirely while the upper head is still pressurized.
Once the core is filled, the pressure in the upper head will cause a collapse of the upper head steam, which will result in the rapid depressurization of the upperhead.
This causes a rapid drain of the downcomer into the core region.
During this rapid draw down, air and steam can be drawn back into the core.
This slug of gas travels through the core, collapsing and rising its way into the upper head where the air provide a pressurizable bubble.
At that point, the downcomer will start to fill again.
\fig{fig:refillCoreVolFracDom} illustrates this macroscopic behavior as calculated by a the simulation with \dtmax{} = \expneg{2.0}{2}{[s]}.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillCoreVolFracDom}
\caption{Effective volume fraction in downcomer and core.}
\label{fig:refillCoreVolFracDom}
\end{figure}

Since this model simulates a core refill event, the parameter of interest will be related to core cooling.
Of particular interest is the amount of condensation that occurs in the section three subchannel in which the safety injection nozzle is located over the course of the transient.
The total amount of this condensation will be of interest for this problem.
The primary variable of engineering interest in this problem is the time-dependent behavior of the condensation in the region of the safety injection inlet and the maximum condensation over the course of the transient.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillGammaLin}
\caption{Condensation in upper head as calculated by the linear solver.}
\label{fig:refillGammaLin}
\end{figure}

First, the linear solution for the four different \dtmax{} is shown in \fig{fig:refillGammaLin}.
This shows the linear solver's behavior.
There is drastic variability in the condensation in the upper head.
However, note that the two smallest \dtmax{} appear to have reached a timestep-size insensitive solution.
Or, more precisely, there is less variability in this quantity over the last two simulations than between any previous two.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillGammaNln}
\caption{Condensation in upper head as calculated by the nonlinear solver.}
\label{fig:refillGammaNln}
\end{figure}

Next, \fig{fig:refillGammaNln} contains the condensation for the four different \dtmax{}.
The axes of this graph are the same as those in \fig{fig:refillGammaLin}.
Note the dramatic decrease both the magnitude and variability of the quantity as a result of using the nonlinear solver.
This results argues that the nonlinear solver is capable of producing solutions that are not only  more consistent than those produced by the linear solver but also different in value.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillGammaDom}
\caption{Condensation in upper head as calculated with domain decomposition algorithm.}
\label{fig:refillGammaDom}
\end{figure}

Running simulation with the domain decomposition active produces the condensation rates shown in \fig{fig:refillGammaDom}.
The two subchannels in section two that represent the core region and the four subchannels in section three above the core region comprise the nonlinear domain in this problem.
These results, while not as consistent as those produced by the global nonlinear solver, are both more consistent and more accurate than those produced by the linear solver.

\begin{figure}[t!hb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillMaxGamma}
\caption{Integrated condensation in upper head for all three algorithms.}
\label{fig:refillMaxGamma}
\end{figure}

Next, the integrated condensation for each of the three solution techniques are shown in \fig{fig:refillMaxGamma}.
This figure shows the integrated condensate for each of the \dtmax{} for each solver.
Note that the linear solver does not produce results that are comparable with the nonlinear solver even at small timestep sizes.
By using the domain decomposition algorithm, a solution that is quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent with the nonlinear solution is obtained.

\begin{figure}[h!tb]
\centering
\input{plots/refillRunTimeRatios}
\caption{Ratios of nonlinear and dual-domain run times to linear run time.}
\label{fig:refillRunTimeRatios}
\end{figure}

Next, the computational cost of the nonlinear and the domain decomposition solution methods are compared in \fig{fig:refillRunTimeRatios}.
This figure shows the ratio of the full nonlinear and the domain decomposition run times to the linear solver's run time.
While the nonlinear solver is approximately eight times more computationally expensive than the linear solver, the domain decomposition is only three times more computationally expensive than the linear solver.
That is a consistent 60\% run time savings while using the domain decomposition algorithm as compared to the full nonlinear solver.
