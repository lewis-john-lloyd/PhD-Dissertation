  abstract = {Interfacial closure models in most two-fluid system codes for reactor
	safety are usually tied to the flow regime map through the mean void
	fraction in a computational cell. When a void fraction discontinuity
	exists in a computational volume, neither heat nor momentum exchange
	at the phase interface for this particular cell can be properly represented
	in finite-difference equations governing the fluid flow. Moreover,
	finite-difference methods with a fixed, Eulerian grid will inaccurately
	predict the cell-to-cell convection of mass, momentum and energy
	when the mean cell macroscopic variables are convected from the cell
	containing the void fraction front. The adequate modeling of two-phase
	mixture levels requires the knowledge of front position and void
	fractions above and below the front. In order to obtain such information,
	an efficient and simple tracking method was implemented in the TRAC-BWR
	code (released April 1984). We have tested this method with a simple
	problem involving a moving two-phase air/water mixture level. The
	results revealed inconsistencies in the behavior of velocities, pressures
	and interfacial friction, and some bounded numerical oscillations.
	Following our numerical experiment, we developed a systematic approach
	to improve the two-phase level tracking method. We present this approach
	and the results of implementation in the TRAC-BWR code.},

	The first analysis used the experimental pressure history from a

	showed that a multiphase CFD code could calculate the thermodynamic
	and hydrodynamic conditions during a rapid blowdown transient. Finally,
	a coupled RELAP5/CFD analysis was performed. The results are presented

  title = {The {CATHARE} code strategy and assessment},
  journal = {Nuclear Engineering and Design},
  year = {1990},
  volume = {124},
  pages = {257 - 284},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {The French thermal-hydraulic code CATHARE is being developed in Grenoble
	by EDF, FRAMATOME and CEA. The best-estimate objectives of CATHARE
	require a very rigorous methodology for development and assessment.
	In particular, the validation process is performed in two steps:
	qualification of the models against separate effect tests and verification
	of the code on integral loop tests. The validation reports and the
	resulting evaluation document and user guidelines manual are delivered
	to the users. This paper illustrates the methodology for the case
	of CATHARE 1 version 1.3.
	
	The qualification process was conducted with reference to a matrix
	of 300 tests selected from experiments on critical flow, flow pattern
	determination, blowdown of heated or adiabatic test sections in various
	geometries, reflooding, boil-off, steam generator and pump behaviour,
	fuel thermomechanics. The results show the adequacy and the consistency
	of the models but indicate some items to be further studied: droplet
	diameter correlation, incipience of boiling model, critical flow
	in diaphragms, top-down rewet or reflood, interphase friction in
	rod bundle geometry.
	
	The verification process was performed on 21 tests coming from LOBI,
	LOFT, LSTF, PKL facilities. The natural circulation post-test calculations
	show good results for single phase or two-phase mass flowrate evaluation
	and a satisfactory prediction of the reflux condensor phase. The
	various phases of the small break or large break transients are generally
	well described by CATHARE. However, some quantitative discrepancies
	underline limited deficiencies in the domain of condensation at safety
	injection, CCFL at steam generator inlet or core upper tie plate,
	multidimensional effects in annular downcomer and in core region,
	modelling of steam generator secondary side.
	
	The consideration of these items led to the introduction of significant
	improvements and new capabilities in the CATHARE 2 version which
	consequently has to be validated following the same two-step process
	and with an extended test matrix.
	
	The efficiency of such a rigorous methodology has induced the French
	nuclear industry (EDF, FRAMATOME) to use CATHARE for safety research
	and development studies.},

  abstract = {CATHARE is a 2-fluid thermal-hydraulic code capable of simulating
	thermal and mechanical phenomena occurring in the primary and secondary
	circuits of PWRs for a wide variety of accidental situations. The
	description of the flow is essentially 1-dimensional. Closure laws
	concerning mass, momentum and energy exchanges between phases and
	between each phase and the walls are required. A set of specifically
	designed separate effect experiments were performed and analysed.
	Having regard for some development principles, correlations are established
	on the basis of experimental data. The mechanical transfer laws are
	derived first from experiments where thermal non equilibrium is negligible.
	Using them as a basis for further interpretation of experimental
	data, interfacial heat transfer laws are then developed. Wall heat
	transfer correlations then have to be fixed. All these steps are
	presented with emphasis being placed on the most recent developments.
	These last investigations concern the direct contact condensation,
	stratification model, wall friction, droplet break up and the scale
	effect, geometrical effect and pressure effect on interfacial friction.},

  abstract = {After a thorough analysis of the industrial needs and of the limitations
	of current simulation tools, EDF and CEA (Commissariat Ã lâ€™Energie
	Atomique) launched the NEPTUNE Project in 2001 (see Guelfi et al.,
	2007) with the support of AREVA-NP and IRSN. The NEPTUNE activities
	include software development, research in physical modeling and numerical
	methods, development of advanced instrumentation techniques and new
	experimental programs. Four different simulation scales were addressed
	including DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation), CFD in open medium (Computational
	Fluid Dynamics), component (subchannel-type analysis) and system
	(reactor modeling) scales.
	
	In 2006 CEA, EDF, AREVA-NP and IRSN defined the strategy for the system
	scale of NEPTUNE and the CATHARE-3 development was launched. The
	main objectives are:â€¢ advanced physical modeling of two-phases
	flows, mainly by using multi-field and turbulence models, â€¢ improved
	3D modeling by the use of fine and non conforming structured meshes,
	â€¢ generalized coupling capabilities with other thermal-hydraulic
	scales and with other disciplines (core physics, structural mechanics,
	â€¦), â€¢ extension of the applicability to new Gen IV reactors (Sodium
	Cooled Fast Breeder Reactors, Gas Cooled Reactors, Supercritical
	Light Water Reactors), â€¢ a true object-oriented code architecture.
	
	
	At the same time CATHARE-3 is in continuity with the CATHARE-2 code
	which is the current industrial version of CATHARE and internationally
	used for nuclear power plant safety analysis, in simulators and in
	coupled simulation tools. The road map of these two codes will allow
	a smooth transition from CATHARE-2 to CATHARE-3 for all users.
	
	This paper gives an overview of the choices made for the development
	of CATHARE-3 including new physical models, validation strategy and
	experimental programs, numerical improvements, enhanced coupling
	capability and software architecture evolution. The current status
	of the project as well as the overall schedule will be presented.},

  abstract = {The development of a fully-implicit scheme to model the two-phase
	three-field flow and heat transfer problem is presented here. The
	model was originally developed to simulate the complex phenomena
	occurring in proximity of the quench front of a nuclear reactor core
	during the reflood phase of a postulated LOCA. The fully-implicit
	method allows relative large time steps to be used even on very fine
	spatial grids which can not be considered when a semi-implicit scheme
	is applied to solve the conservation equation. The objective of this
	paper is to capture as much as possible, the lessons learned during
	the development and coding of the fully-implicit two-phase three-field
	model. The implementation of the model is one of the most time consuming
	and a challenging task. The literature on numerical models generally
	concentrates on the theoretical aspects of the numerical method but
	available information on the problems encountered during the implementation
	of such methods for real applications is scarce. The reason is that
	many of these methods are tailored to specific applications and sometimes
	are rather empirical. These techniques are the result of a long and
	tedious trial and error process from the developer. The article presented
	here attempts to provide some insights and guidelines for future
	development of this or similar models.},

  abstract = {A nonlinear additive Schwarz preconditioned inexact Newton method
	(ASPIN) was introduced recently for solving large sparse highly nonlinear
	systems of equations obtained from the discretization of nonlinear
	partial differential equations. In this paper, we discuss some extensions
	of ASPIN for solving steady-state incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes
	equations with high Reynolds numbers in the velocityâ€“pressure formulation.
	The key idea of ASPIN is to find the solution of the original system
	by solving a nonlinearly preconditioned system that has the same
	solution as the original system, but with more balanced nonlinearities.
	Our parallel nonlinear preconditioner is constructed using a nonlinear
	overlapping additive Schwarz method. To show the robustness and scalability
	of the algorithm, we present some numerical results obtained on a
	parallel computer for two benchmark problems: a driven cavity flow
	problem and a backward-facing step problem with high Reynolds numbers.
	The sparse nonlinear system is obtained by applying a Q1&#xa0;âˆ’&#xa0;Q1
	Galerkin least squares finite element discretization on two-dimensional
	unstructured meshes. We compare our approach with an inexact Newton
	method using different choices of forcing terms. Our numerical results
	show that ASPIN has good convergence and is more robust than the
	traditional inexact Newton method with respect to certain parameters
	such as the Reynolds number, the mesh size, and the number of processors.},

	efficiency, while algorithm implementation is simplified using a
	numerical Jacobian evaluation.
	
	
	The capabilities of standard Newton-Krylov algorithms are demonstrated
	via solutions to both incompressible and compressible flow problems.
	Incompressible flow problems include natural convection in an enclosed
	cavity, and mixdforced convection past a backward facing step. Additionally,
	matrix-free Newton-Krylov implementations are constructed by approximating
	the Jacobian-vector products appearing in the Krylov algorithms with
	finite difference approximations. Performance of the matrix-fiee
	implementation is found to depend upon problem size, problem nonlinearity,
	and Krylov algorithm selection. Higher order accurate solutions for
	mixed convection flow are obtained using the third order cubic upwind
	interpolation scheme (CUI) convection scheme with a defect correction
	procedure and several CPU performance enhancement techniques. Solution
	efficiency for high Reynolds number forced convection flow is investigated
	using a discrete pressure equation formulation, alternative cell
	ordering strategies, and pseudo-transient relaxation. Solutions to
	the compressible flow problem, consisting of low Mach number subsonic
	flow past a backstep, found ILU preconditioners to be strongly sensitive
	to cell ordering and less effective than domain based preconditioners
	at low Mach numbers.},

	coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is
	carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher

  number = {1},
  abstract = {For some time it has been known that many of the two-phase flow models
	lead to ill-posed Cauchy problems because they have complex characteristic
	values. A necessary condition (at least in the linear case) for the
	Cauchy problem to be well-posed is that it be stable in the sense
	of von Neumann. For systems of partial differential equations of
	first order, stability in the sense of von Neumann is essentially
	equivalent to the condition that the model be hyperbolic (all real
	characteristic values and complete set of characteristic vectors).
	Herein models are developed which have real characteristic values
	for all physically acceptable states (state space) and except for
	a set of measure zero have a complete set of characteristic vectors
	in state space. Therefore, these models are hyperbolic a.e. (almost
	everywhere) in state space. Also, they are stable in the sense of
	von Neumann a.e. in state space even without inclusion of viscosity
	terms. The models discussed herein are developed for the case of
	two-phase separated planar flow and include transverse momentum considerations.
	These models are referred to as â€œtwo-pressureâ€� models because
	each phase is assumed to exist at an average pressure different from
	the average pressure in the other phase; the pressure fields are
	related through momentum considerations. Numerical results on a steady-state
	problem show good agreement with existing steady-state results. Numerical
	results on a transient problem agree with a single-pressure model
	until the onset of numerical instability in the single-pressure model.
	Compared to the single-pressure (hydrostatic) model, the two-pressure
	model approximates additional physical features and is shown to be
	a viable approach for the case of separated flow.},

  journal = {Annals of Nuclear Energy},
  year = {1996},
  volume = {23},
  pages = {801 - 811},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {A mechanistic model is developed to analyze the swelling phenomena
	caused by flashing in a tank. Up to now, in the case of flashing
	in a tank, there is no reliable mechanistic model available to predict
	the swelling level and the void fraction when the flashing occurs.
	In this paper, a mechanistic model is developed to predict the swelling
	level, the average void fraction, and the pressure transients in
	the case of blow down of steam from a tank. Both the equilibrium
	model and the non-equilibrium model are developed to analyze the
	flashing phenomena in a tank. Thus, in the equilibrium model, detailed
	knowledge of the gas bubble generation and growth is not needed.
	In the case of the non-equilibrium model, liquid can be superheated
	by depressurization, and the bubble generation rate is calculated
	as a function of superheat. By applying a Lagrangian approach, the
	bubble growth rate and the total volume of gas can be calculated.
	Computer programs for the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium models
	are developed. Results are compared with experimental data. For pressure
	and venting rate, the results of both the equilibrium model and the
	non-equilibrium model agree very well with the experimental data.
	The equilibrium model is not accurate in predicting swelling level
	and void fraction because the model does not use detailed information
	about bubble generation and growth. For swelling level and void fraction,
	results of the proposed non-equilibrium model agree well with the
	experimental data.},

	allows RELAP5-3DÂ© to be used with other computer programs to perform
	integrated analyses of nuclear power reactor systems and related

	different programs to be used to model different portions of the

	the phenomena that are important in the simulation in the various
	portions of the system being considered and may use different numbers
	of conservation equations to model fluid flow in their respective
	solution domains. The methodology was demonstrated using a test case
	in which the test geometry was divided into two parts, each of which
	was solved as a RELAP5-3DÂ© simulation. This test problem exercised
	all of the semi-implicit coupling features that were implemented
	in RELAP5-3DÂ© The results of this verification test case show that
	the semi-implicit coupling methodology produces the same answer as
	the simulation of the test system as a single process.},

  abstract = {The state of the art in modeling reflooding situations, mainly with
	the two-fluid system analysis codes, is reviewed; certain related
	general code development issues are included. Our current modeling
	of reflooding is reasonable and can be made sufficiently conservative
	for safety assessments, but it is not outstanding. Fundamental understanding
	of the detailed two-phase flow and heat transfer mechanisms has not
	progressed significantly over the state already available several
	years ago.
	
	The better understanding of system behavior achieved by the coordinated
	program of large-scale experiments is summarized and its impact on
	the modeling work discussed. In the future, factors such as the additional
	accident scenaria now considered, the new and advanced reactor types
	being analyzed, and the geometric growth of computing capacity are
	likely to drive our efforts. The new requirements and challenges
	can be met best by building into the codes pieces of understanding
	of the actual physical processes at the most fundamental level practicable.
	
	The discussion focuses on the existing codes and their successes and
	shortcomings; both certain specialized and the more complex general-purpose
	system codes are considered. The aim is not to conduct an exhaustive
	review of all aspects of the problem, but rather to reach consensus
	on certain issues.},

	(CA) technique that is integrated into the popular SIMPLER algorithm
	for CFD problems. In the model, the CA technique deals with the microscopic
	nonlinear dynamic interactions of bubbles while the traditional CFD
	algorithm is used to determine macroscopic system parameters such
	as pressure and temperature. The popular SIMPLER algorithm is employed
	for the CFD treatment. The model is then employed to simulate a pool
	boiling process. The computational results show that the CAS model
	can reproduce most of the basic features of boiling and capture the
	fundamental characteristics of boiling phenomena. The heat transfer
	coefficient predicted by the CAS model is in excellent agreement
	with the experimental data and existing empirical correlations.},
