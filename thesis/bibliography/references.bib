  abstract = {Interfacial closure models in most two-fluid system codes for reactor
	safety are usually tied to the flow regime map through the mean void
	fraction in a computational cell. When a void fraction discontinuity
	exists in a computational volume, neither heat nor momentum exchange
	at the phase interface for this particular cell can be properly represented
	in finite-difference equations governing the fluid flow. Moreover,
	finite-difference methods with a fixed, Eulerian grid will inaccurately
	predict the cell-to-cell convection of mass, momentum and energy
	when the mean cell macroscopic variables are convected from the cell
	containing the void fraction front. The adequate modeling of two-phase
	mixture levels requires the knowledge of front position and void
	fractions above and below the front. In order to obtain such information,
	an efficient and simple tracking method was implemented in the TRAC-BWR
	code (released April 1984). We have tested this method with a simple
	problem involving a moving two-phase air/water mixture level. The
	results revealed inconsistencies in the behavior of velocities, pressures
	and interfacial friction, and some bounded numerical oscillations.
	Following our numerical experiment, we developed a systematic approach
	to improve the two-phase level tracking method. We present this approach
	and the results of implementation in the TRAC-BWR code.},

	to RELAP5-3D. Several calculations were performed with this code.
	The first analysis used the experimental pressure history from a
	point just upstream of the break as a boundary condition. This analysis
	showed that a multiphase CFD code could calculate the thermodynamic
	and hydrodynamic conditions during a rapid blowdown transient. Finally,
	a coupled RELAP5/CFD analysis was performed. The results are presented

  title = {The {CATHARE} code strategy and assessment},
  journal = {Nuclear Engineering and Design},
  year = {1990},
  volume = {124},
  pages = {257 - 284},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {The French thermal-hydraulic code CATHARE is being developed in Grenoble
	by EDF, FRAMATOME and CEA. The best-estimate objectives of CATHARE
	require a very rigorous methodology for development and assessment.
	In particular, the validation process is performed in two steps:
	qualification of the models against separate effect tests and verification
	of the code on integral loop tests. The validation reports and the
	resulting evaluation document and user guidelines manual are delivered
	to the users. This paper illustrates the methodology for the case
	of CATHARE 1 version 1.3.
	
	The qualification process was conducted with reference to a matrix
	of 300 tests selected from experiments on critical flow, flow pattern
	determination, blowdown of heated or adiabatic test sections in various
	geometries, reflooding, boil-off, steam generator and pump behaviour,
	fuel thermomechanics. The results show the adequacy and the consistency
	of the models but indicate some items to be further studied: droplet
	diameter correlation, incipience of boiling model, critical flow
	in diaphragms, top-down rewet or reflood, interphase friction in
	rod bundle geometry.
	
	The verification process was performed on 21 tests coming from LOBI,
	LOFT, LSTF, PKL facilities. The natural circulation post-test calculations
	show good results for single phase or two-phase mass flowrate evaluation
	and a satisfactory prediction of the reflux condensor phase. The
	various phases of the small break or large break transients are generally
	well described by CATHARE. However, some quantitative discrepancies
	underline limited deficiencies in the domain of condensation at safety
	injection, CCFL at steam generator inlet or core upper tie plate,
	multidimensional effects in annular downcomer and in core region,
	modelling of steam generator secondary side.
	
	The consideration of these items led to the introduction of significant
	improvements and new capabilities in the CATHARE 2 version which
	consequently has to be validated following the same two-step process
	and with an extended test matrix.
	
	The efficiency of such a rigorous methodology has induced the French
	nuclear industry (EDF, FRAMATOME) to use CATHARE for safety research
	and development studies.},

  abstract = {CATHARE is a 2-fluid thermal-hydraulic code capable of simulating
	thermal and mechanical phenomena occurring in the primary and secondary
	circuits of PWRs for a wide variety of accidental situations. The

	concerning mass, momentum and energy exchanges between phases and
	between each phase and the walls are required. A set of specifically
	designed separate effect experiments were performed and analysed.
	Having regard for some development principles, correlations are established
	on the basis of experimental data. The mechanical transfer laws are
	derived first from experiments where thermal non equilibrium is negligible.
	Using them as a basis for further interpretation of experimental
	data, interfacial heat transfer laws are then developed. Wall heat
	transfer correlations then have to be fixed. All these steps are
	presented with emphasis being placed on the most recent developments.
	These last investigations concern the direct contact condensation,
	stratification model, wall friction, droplet break up and the scale
	effect, geometrical effect and pressure effect on interfacial friction.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with 3D numerical simulation of assemblies of a high
	temperature helium cooled reactor core. The present aim is to investigate
	an emergency situation due to the blocking of few Helium channels
	in the core. In this situation, some Helium channels for coolant
	passage are blocked and the related issue is the temperature distribution
	within the assemblies, as well as the locations of the local extrema
	in graphite and fuel media, that must not exceed 1600 °C. Two configurations
	are investigated, depending on the situation of the blocked fuel
	assembly in the core. The blocked assembly is surrounded by six unblocked
	fuel assemblies in the first situation and by five unblocked fuel
	assemblies and one reflector assembly in the second situation. This
	numerical study is performed using the thermal-hydraulic CFD code
	Trio_U. Trio_U is developed at CEA Grenoble and especially designed
	to simulate unsteady turbulent flows developing in complex geometries.
	For the present work, an accurate description of 3D conduction problem
	(graphite and fuel), coupled with a simplified 1D thermal-hydraulic
	modelling for Helium is used. The reported simulations suggest that
	the main temperature increase is limited to the blocked fuel assembly
	and do not spread over surrounded assemblies. This seems to be due
	to the Helium flow rate in the gaps between blocks. Moreover, the
	present results show that the maximum temperature criterion is not
	respected for the blocking conditions at nominal power for the blocked
	assembly.},

  abstract = {After a thorough analysis of the industrial needs and of the limitations
	of current simulation tools, EDF and CEA (Commissariat Ã lâ€™Energie
	Atomique) launched the NEPTUNE Project in 2001 (see Guelfi et al.,
	2007) with the support of AREVA-NP and IRSN. The NEPTUNE activities
	include software development, research in physical modeling and numerical
	methods, development of advanced instrumentation techniques and new
	experimental programs. Four different simulation scales were addressed
	including DNS (Direct Numerical Simulation), CFD in open medium (Computational
	Fluid Dynamics), component (subchannel-type analysis) and system
	(reactor modeling) scales.
	
	In 2006 CEA, EDF, AREVA-NP and IRSN defined the strategy for the system
	scale of NEPTUNE and the CATHARE-3 development was launched. The
	main objectives are:â€¢ advanced physical modeling of two-phases
	flows, mainly by using multi-field and turbulence models, â€¢ improved
	3D modeling by the use of fine and non conforming structured meshes,
	â€¢ generalized coupling capabilities with other thermal-hydraulic
	scales and with other disciplines (core physics, structural mechanics,
	â€¦), â€¢ extension of the applicability to new Gen IV reactors (Sodium
	Cooled Fast Breeder Reactors, Gas Cooled Reactors, Supercritical
	Light Water Reactors), â€¢ a true object-oriented code architecture.
	
	
	At the same time CATHARE-3 is in continuity with the CATHARE-2 code
	which is the current industrial version of CATHARE and internationally
	used for nuclear power plant safety analysis, in simulators and in
	coupled simulation tools. The road map of these two codes will allow
	a smooth transition from CATHARE-2 to CATHARE-3 for all users.
	
	This paper gives an overview of the choices made for the development
	of CATHARE-3 including new physical models, validation strategy and
	experimental programs, numerical improvements, enhanced coupling
	capability and software architecture evolution. The current status

  abstract = {The development of a fully-implicit scheme to model the two-phase
	three-field flow and heat transfer problem is presented here. The
	model was originally developed to simulate the complex phenomena
	occurring in proximity of the quench front of a nuclear reactor core
	during the reflood phase of a postulated LOCA. The fully-implicit
	method allows relative large time steps to be used even on very fine
	spatial grids which can not be considered when a semi-implicit scheme
	is applied to solve the conservation equation. The objective of this
	paper is to capture as much as possible, the lessons learned during
	the development and coding of the fully-implicit two-phase three-field
	model. The implementation of the model is one of the most time consuming
	and a challenging task. The literature on numerical models generally
	concentrates on the theoretical aspects of the numerical method but
	available information on the problems encountered during the implementation
	of such methods for real applications is scarce. The reason is that
	many of these methods are tailored to specific applications and sometimes
	are rather empirical. These techniques are the result of a long and
	tedious trial and error process from the developer. The article presented
	here attempts to provide some insights and guidelines for future
	development of this or similar models.},

	using some of the experimental data as input for the simulations

	(ASPIN) was introduced recently for solving large sparse highly nonlinear
	systems of equations obtained from the discretization of nonlinear
	partial differential equations. In this paper, we discuss some extensions
	of ASPIN for solving steady-state incompressible Navierâ€“Stokes
	equations with high Reynolds numbers in the velocityâ€“pressure formulation.
	The key idea of ASPIN is to find the solution of the original system
	by solving a nonlinearly preconditioned system that has the same
	solution as the original system, but with more balanced nonlinearities.
	Our parallel nonlinear preconditioner is constructed using a nonlinear
	overlapping additive Schwarz method. To show the robustness and scalability
	of the algorithm, we present some numerical results obtained on a
	parallel computer for two benchmark problems: a driven cavity flow
	problem and a backward-facing step problem with high Reynolds numbers.
	The sparse nonlinear system is obtained by applying a Q1&#xa0;âˆ’&#xa0;Q1
	Galerkin least squares finite element discretization on two-dimensional
	unstructured meshes. We compare our approach with an inexact Newton
	method using different choices of forcing terms. Our numerical results
	show that ASPIN has good convergence and is more robust than the
	traditional inexact Newton method with respect to certain parameters
	such as the Reynolds number, the mesh size, and the number of processors.},

	Using Finite Volume Discretization},
  institution = {Idaho National Engineering Laboratory},
  year = {1995},
  number = {INEL-95/0118},
  abstract = {Fully coupled, Newton-Krylov algorithms are investigated for solving
	sttongly coupled, nonlinear systems of partial differential equations
	arising in the field of computational fluid dynamics. Primitive variable
	forms of the steady incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes
	and energy equations that describe the flow of a laminar Newtonian
	fluid in two-dimensions are specifically considered. Numerical solutions
	are obtained by first integrating over discrete finite volumes that
	compose the computational mesh. The resulting system of nonlinear
	algebraic equations are linearized using Newton's method. Preconditioned
	Krylov subspace based iterative algorithms then solve these linear
	systems on each Newton iteration. Selected Krylov algorithms include
	the Amoldi-based Generalized Minimal RESidual (GMRES) algorithm,
	and the Lanczos-based Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS), Bi-CGSTAB,
	and Transpose-Free Quasi-Minimal Residual (TFQMR) algorithms. Both
	Incomplete Lower-Upper @.U) factorization and domain-based additive
	and multiplicative Schwan preconditioning strategies are studied.
	Numerical techniques such as mesh sequencing, adaptive damping, pseudo-transient
	relaxation, and parameter continuation are used to improve the solution
	efficiency, while algorithm implementation is simplified using a
	numerical Jacobian evaluation.
	
	
	The capabilities of standard Newton-Krylov algorithms are demonstrated
	via solutions to both incompressible and compressible flow problems.
	Incompressible flow problems include natural convection in an enclosed
	cavity, and mixdforced convection past a backward facing step. Additionally,
	matrix-free Newton-Krylov implementations are constructed by approximating
	the Jacobian-vector products appearing in the Krylov algorithms with
	finite difference approximations. Performance of the matrix-fiee
	implementation is found to depend upon problem size, problem nonlinearity,
	and Krylov algorithm selection. Higher order accurate solutions for
	mixed convection flow are obtained using the third order cubic upwind
	interpolation scheme (CUI) convection scheme with a defect correction
	procedure and several CPU performance enhancement techniques. Solution
	efficiency for high Reynolds number forced convection flow is investigated
	using a discrete pressure equation formulation, alternative cell
	ordering strategies, and pseudo-transient relaxation. Solutions to
	the compressible flow problem, consisting of low Mach number subsonic
	flow past a backstep, found ILU preconditioners to be strongly sensitive
	to cell ordering and less effective than domain based preconditioners
	at low Mach numbers.},

	to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall
	computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to OS techniques
	that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms
	and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques
	with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied
	for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics
	lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance
	model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made

	nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block
	coupling strategy (without having recourse to an OS strategy) is
	carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher
	order Implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) schemes. The conclusions from these
	results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping
	methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution

  number = {1},
  abstract = {For some time it has been known that many of the two-phase flow models
	lead to ill-posed Cauchy problems because they have complex characteristic
	values. A necessary condition (at least in the linear case) for the
	Cauchy problem to be well-posed is that it be stable in the sense
	of von Neumann. For systems of partial differential equations of
	first order, stability in the sense of von Neumann is essentially
	equivalent to the condition that the model be hyperbolic (all real
	characteristic values and complete set of characteristic vectors).
	Herein models are developed which have real characteristic values
	for all physically acceptable states (state space) and except for
	a set of measure zero have a complete set of characteristic vectors
	in state space. Therefore, these models are hyperbolic a.e. (almost
	everywhere) in state space. Also, they are stable in the sense of
	von Neumann a.e. in state space even without inclusion of viscosity
	terms. The models discussed herein are developed for the case of
	two-phase separated planar flow and include transverse momentum considerations.
	These models are referred to as â€œtwo-pressureâ€� models because
	each phase is assumed to exist at an average pressure different from
	the average pressure in the other phase; the pressure fields are
	related through momentum considerations. Numerical results on a steady-state
	problem show good agreement with existing steady-state results. Numerical
	results on a transient problem agree with a single-pressure model
	until the onset of numerical instability in the single-pressure model.
	Compared to the single-pressure (hydrostatic) model, the two-pressure
	model approximates additional physical features and is shown to be
	a viable approach for the case of separated flow.},

	of the governing differential equations is determined in terms of
	gas and liquid momentum flux parameters. It is shown that the two-fluid
	model is well posed with certain restrictions on the liquid and gas
	momentum flux parameters. Simplified flow configurations for bubbly
	flow, slug flow, and annular flow are constructed to test the validity
	of proposed stability criteria. The momentum flux parameters are
	calculated for these flow configurations by assuming a power-law
	profile for both velocity and void fraction. Existing correlation
	for volumetric distribution parameter Co is used. By employing simplified
	velocity profiles, the void fraction profile is determined from Co
	correlation. It is found that the void fraction is wall-peaked at
	low void fraction and it becomes center-peaked as the void fraction
	increases. A simplified annular flow is also constructed. With these
	flow configurations, the momentum flux parameters are determined.
	It is shown that the calculated momentum flux parameters are located
	in the stable region above the analytically determined stability
	boundary. The analyses results indicate that the use of momentum
	flux parameter is promising, since they reflect flow structure and
	help to stabilize the governing differential equations.},

	In this paper, a mechanistic model is developed to predict the swelling
	level, the average void fraction, and the pressure transients in
	the case of blow down of steam from a tank. Both the equilibrium
	model and the non-equilibrium model are developed to analyze the
	flashing phenomena in a tank. Thus, in the equilibrium model, detailed
	knowledge of the gas bubble generation and growth is not needed.
	In the case of the non-equilibrium model, liquid can be superheated
	by depressurization, and the bubble generation rate is calculated
	as a function of superheat. By applying a Lagrangian approach, the
	bubble growth rate and the total volume of gas can be calculated.
	Computer programs for the equilibrium and the non-equilibrium models
	are developed. Results are compared with experimental data. For pressure
	and venting rate, the results of both the equilibrium model and the
	non-equilibrium model agree very well with the experimental data.
	The equilibrium model is not accurate in predicting swelling level
	and void fraction because the model does not use detailed information
	about bubble generation and growth. For swelling level and void fraction,
	results of the proposed non-equilibrium model agree well with the

  abstract = {A simple analytical model is proposed and shown to capture the essence
	of the direct containment heating phenomenon. The model is based
	on assuming thermal/chemical equilibrium in the melt dispersal (flow)
	process, and separation of the melt out of this [`]equilibrium steam'
	in the intermediate compartment. The model reveals a natural scale
	(hence named the [`]DCH scale') for the DCH phenomenon, and the results
	are in very good agreement with the Integral Effects Tests series.
	On this basis, reactor predictions can be made quite simply, provided
	that the DCH scale for the particular condition of interest is known.
	This prediction of DCH scale is also addressed by a scaling approach
	that is shown to be consistent with the experimental data. Finally,
	reactor predictions (of DCH loads) are also included in generalized
	terms convenient for use under a wide variety of conditions. In general,
	the results appear to be well within the structural capability of
	large dry containments.},

  abstract = {The SMAC (Simplified Marker And Cell) algorithm is extended for an
	application to thermal non-equilibrium two-phase flows in light water
	nuclear reactors (LWRs). A two-fluid three-field model is adopted
	and a multi-dimensional unstructured grid is used for complicated
	geometries. The phase change and the time derivative terms appearing
	in the continuity equations are implemented implicitly in the pressure
	correction step. The energy equations are decoupled from the momentum
	equations for faster convergence. The verification of the present
	numerical method was carried out against a set of test problems which
	includes the single and the two-phase flows. The results are also
	compared to those of the semi-implicit ICE method, where the energy
	equations are coupled with the momentum equation for pressure correction.},
