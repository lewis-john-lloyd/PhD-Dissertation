Of primary concern in reactor safety analysis is thermal-hydraulic behaviour of the nuclear core during off-normal conditions. In order to evaluate 

\subgroup{Two Phase Flow}
The physical behaviour of fluids within COBRA are represented by a set of differential equations.
These governing equations are a collection of balance laws.
Balance laws are statements of conservation that include external sources and sinks.
The physical quantities being tracked by COBRA are mass, momentum, and energy.
Since COBRA models two phase behaviour, the
